Will-They-Won't-They: A Very Large Dataset for Stance Detection on Twitter </b><br>

Will-They-Won't-They (WT-WT) is a large dataset of English tweets targeted at stance detection for the rumor verification task. The dataset is constructed based on tweets that discuss five recent merger and acquisition (M&A) operations of US companies, mainly from the healthcare sector.

All the annotations are carried out by domain experts; therefore, the dataset constitutes a high-quality and reliable benchmark for future research in stance detection.
