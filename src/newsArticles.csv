0,"Dec 3, 2017",Reuters,CVS Health to acquire Aetna for $69 billion in year's largest acquisition,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp CVS.N said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies.

This year’s largest corporate acquisition will combine one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans.

The deal comes after Aetna's $37 billion plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurance peer Humana Inc HUM.N was blocked in January by a U.S. federal judge over antitrust concerns. A proposed combination of peers Anthem Inc ANTM.N and Cigna Corp CI.N was also shot down.

Aetna shareholders stand to receive $207 per share in the deal with CVS, the companies said. The consideration comprises $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS shares for each Aetna share. Reuters first reported the terms of the deal earlier on Sunday.

Aetna shareholders will own about 22 percent of the combined company, while CVS shareholders will own the remainder.

The companies said that cost synergies in the second full year after the transaction closes -- 2020 if the deal closes in the second half of 2018 as they expect -- would amount to $750 million. They foresee it adding to adjusted earnings per share by the low- to mid-single digit percentage points.

Their vision expands beyond capitalizing on CVS’ existing MinuteClinic structure, which largely offers preventative services like flu shots, the companies’ chief executives said in an interview.

“When you walk into CVS there’s the pharmacy. What if there’s a vision and audiology center, and perhaps a nutritionist, and some sort of care manager?” CVS CEO Larry Merlo said.

Aetna will be operated as a separate unit and Aetna’s existing leadership is expected to run the Aetna businesses, Merlo said. Aetna will have two of its directors, in addition to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini join the board of CVS.

The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to a shifting landscape, including changes in the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.

CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to provide medical services to Aetna’s roughly 23 million medical members. In addition to health clinics and medical equipment, CVS could provide assistance with vision, hearing and nutrition.

A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS’s front-of-store retail business.

The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments.

That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits.

Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna’s insurance business and CVS’s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM’s leverage with drugmakers.

Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients.

Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act.

Large corporate customers of Aetna are taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding the impact on costs, benefits experts have said.

Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.

It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O and Humana Inc HUM.N, or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT.N, Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently.

VERTICAL MERGER

Although CVS and Aetna’s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors.

Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc's T.N planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc TWX.N, saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice.

The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off.

It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon.

""(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,"" said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T Inc T.N from buying Time Warner Inc TWX.N.

CVS announced its acquisition of Aetna for $69 billion on Sunday.

The deal is the largest in 2017 and comes as rumors that Amazon could be entering the healthcare space circulate.

But the acquisition has nothing to do with Amazon and is simply good for business, according to some analysts.

Watch shares of CVS trade in real time here.



CVS Health is set to acquire Aetna for $69 billion in the year's biggest deal, the companies announced on Sunday.

Some analysts have speculated that Amazon's baby steps into the healthcare industry could have spurred the acquisition, but that is decidedly not the case, George Hill, an analyst at RBC, said on Monday.

Instead, the deal would be a way for CVS and Aetna to make healthcare delivery more efficient, according to Hill. ""We view this deal as offensive by both companies, looking to a more vertically integrated, consumer directed, value-based care delivery future, and not a response to any threat from Amazon,"" Hill said.

Amazon's entry into the healthcare space is only speculative at this point and details are scarce. The company was approved for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states in October and has been reportedly looking to make hires aimed at jumpstarting a pharmacy business.

Hill said that regardless of Amazon's plans, the CVS-Aetna deal still makes sense for the two companies. Owning a pharmacy benefit manager to better negotiate prices with drugmakers could eliminate a middleman for CVS, and allow it to bring in a greater portion of the profits available on a drug's journey to the customer.

A research note from Macquarie backed up Hill's thinking.

""We believe the acquisition represents the next evolution in healthcare services following the commingling of retail pharmacy, PBM and drug distribution business creating further, necessary economies of scale and an overall ecosystem that will be impossible for non-healthcare entities to compete with,"" Macquarie wrote. ""More importantly, transition should end the misplaced talk that Amazon.com matters in this silo.""

The deal is still pending regulatory approval, which is less than certain in the face of comments about the AT&T-Time Warner deal from President Trump and the Department of Justice. Aetna's stock is trading about 10% lower than the proposed price of the deal, evidence of investors' uncertainty.

CVS is down 3.13% on Monday, and Aetna is up 1.65%. Amazon is down 1.14% amid a broader tech selloff.

2,"Dec 3, 2017",PR Newswire,"CVS Health to Acquire Aetna; Combination to Provide Consumers with a Better Experience, Reduced Costs and Improved Access to Health Care Experts in Homes and Communities Across the Country","WOONSOCKET, R.I. and HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), a company at the forefront of changing the health care landscape, and Aetna (NYSE: AET), one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies, today announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement under which CVS Health will acquire all outstanding shares of Aetna for a combination of cash and stock. Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved today by the boards of directors of each company, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction values Aetna at approximately $207 per share or approximately $69 billion1. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, the total value of the transaction is $77 billion.

This transaction fills an unmet need in the current health care system and presents a unique opportunity to redefine access to high-quality care in lower cost, local settings—whether in the community, at home, or through digital tools.

CVS Health President and Chief Executive Officer Larry J. Merlo said, ""This combination brings together the expertise of two great companies to remake the consumer health care experience. With the analytics of Aetna and CVS Health's human touch, we will create a health care platform built around individuals. We look forward to working with the talented people at Aetna to position the combined company as America's front door to quality health care, integrating more closely the work of doctors, pharmacists, other health care professionals and health benefits companies to create a platform that is easier to use and less expensive for consumers.""

This is a natural evolution for both companies as they seek to put the consumer at the center of health care delivery. CVS Health has steadily become an integrated health care company, and Aetna has moved beyond being a traditional insurer to focus more on consumer well-being.

""This is the next step in our journey, positioning the combined company to dramatically further empower consumers. Together with CVS Health, we will better understand our members' health goals, guide them through the health care system and help them achieve their best health,"" said Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna chairman and CEO. ""Aetna has a proud tradition of continually innovating to address unmet consumer needs and providing leading products and services to the marketplace.""

Bertolini continued, ""Aetna has a talented and dedicated group of employees working to build a healthier world every day. Our combined company will be more competitive in the marketplace and accelerate progress toward achieving this mission.""

Today, increasing numbers of consumers are taking on more and more responsibility for paying for their health care as the burden of costs is being shifted to them. Together, CVS Health and Aetna will be a trusted community partner who will help consumers better manage the cost of the health care they need. The combined company will also be well positioned to more effectively meet the health needs of many more people, especially the 50 percent of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80 percent of all health care costs. Finally, capabilities developed following this transaction will directly benefit clients of both companies and enable them to better manage their health care costs.

BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS

Uniquely Integrated, Community-Based Health Care Experience

Consumers will benefit from a uniquely integrated, community-based health care experience. The combined company will also be able to better understand patients' health goals, guide them through the health care system, and help them achieve their best health. There will be expanded opportunities to bring health care services to consumers every day. CVS Pharmacy locations will include space for wellness, clinical and pharmacy services, vision, hearing, nutrition, beauty, and medical equipment, in addition to the products and services our customers currently enjoy. An entirely new health services offering available in many locations will function as a community-based health hub dedicated to connecting the pathways needed to improve health and answering patients' questions about their health conditions, as well as prescription drugs and health coverage.

This personalized health care experience will be delivered by connecting Aetna's extensive network of providers with greater consumer access through CVS Health. This includes more than 9,700 CVS Pharmacy locations and 1,100 MinuteClinic walk-in clinics—as well as further extensions into the community through Omnicare's senior pharmacy solutions, Coram's infusion services, and the more than 4,000 CVS Health nursing professionals providing in-clinic and home-based care across the nation. As a result, there will be a better opportunity to utilize local care solutions in a more integrated fashion with the goal of improving patient outcomes.

More Integrated Data and Analytics

The entire health care system will also benefit from broader use of data and analytics, leading to improved patient health at substantially lower cost. This will be achieved, for example, by helping patients avoid unnecessary hospital readmissions. Twenty percent of Medicare patients are readmitted to the hospital soon after being discharged at significant annual costs, much of which is avoidable. Readmission rates can be cut in half if patients have a complete review of their medications after discharge from the hospital to help them manage their care at home. In addition, home devices to monitor activity levels, pulse, and respiratory rates can be used to prevent readmissions. Rather than feeling lost and confused, selected high risk patients discharged from the hospital, or their caregivers, will be able to stop at a health hub location to access services such as medication evaluations, home monitoring and use of durable medical equipment, as needed. All of these services will complement and be integrated with the care provided by their physician and medical team.

Opportunity to Better Fight Chronic Disease

The combined entity will be able to help address the growing cost of treating chronic diseases in important ways. For example, there are 30 million Americans suffering from diabetes, costing the health care system approximately $245 billion annually. Patients with diabetes will receive care in between doctor visits through face-to-face counseling at a store-based health hub and remote monitoring of key indicators such as blood glucose levels. When needed, patients can receive text messages to let them know when their glucose levels deviate from normal ranges. As a follow up, patients can receive counseling on medication adherence, pick up diabetes-related supplies and engage ancillary services such as counsel on weight loss and programs designed to reverse diabetes through nutrition. This will result in better control of their blood sugar levels and better health, which should be appreciated by both patients and their doctors.

""These types of interventions are things that the traditional health care system could be doing,"" commented Merlo, ""but the traditional health care system lacks the key elements of convenience and coordination that help to engage consumers in their health. That's what the combination of CVS Health and Aetna will deliver.""

BENEFITS FOR SHAREHOLDERS

As a result of this transaction, shareholders are expected to benefit from a number of outcomes, including enhanced competitive positioning; low- to mid-single digit accretion in the second full year after the close of the transaction, including the ability to deliver $750 million in near-term synergies; and a platform from which to accelerate growth. The combination over the longer term has the potential to deliver significant incremental value as it will spur the development of new products and generate significant new growth opportunities as a uniquely integrated retailer, pharmacy benefits manager and health plan. Aetna shareholders will receive attractive value from the transaction, including $145 per share in cash, and the ability to participate in the future success and high growth potential of the combined company.

TRANSACTION DETAILS

Transaction Terms

Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Aetna common stock will be exchanged for $145.00 in cash and 0.8378 shares of CVS Health common stock. Upon closing of the transaction, Aetna shareholders will own approximately 22% of the combined company and CVS Health shareholders will own approximately 78%.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018. It is subject to approval by CVS Health and Aetna shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Financing of the Transaction

CVS Health intends to fund the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of existing cash on hand and debt financing. The transaction is not contingent upon receipt of financing. Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are providing $49 billion of financing commitments.

Governance Details

Upon the closing of the transaction, three of Aetna's directors, including Aetna's Chairman and CEO Mark T. Bertolini, will be added to the CVS Health Board of Directors. In addition, members of the Aetna management team will play significant roles in the newly combined company. Aetna will operate as a stand-alone business unit within the CVS Health enterprise and will be led by members of their current management team.

""There's a lot of excitement and energy in both organizations, and folks are ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo told CNBC in an interview Wednesday.

The final deal valued Aetna at $212 per share, CVS said in a press release, or about $70 billion, up from the previously agreed upon $207 per share, or roughly $69 billion. CVS will now need to integrate Aetna and start trying to accomplish its three main priorities: making health care local and accessible, simplifying how consumers access care and lowering costs.

The merger combines CVS' pharmacies with Aetna's insurance business, blurring traditionally distinct lines in hopes of lowering costs. CVS also has one of largest pharmacy benefits managers through CVS Caremark and a major Medicare Part D plan sponsor through its SilverScript unit.

It's been a year in the making, but CVS Health finally closed Wednesday on its acquisition of Aetna , creating a new health-care powerhouse.

Consumers won't immediately see any differences in their local stores, Merlo said. Early next year, CVS plans to start testing stores with added health services. These new locations will likely focus on managing common chronic conditions, adding more primary health services at CVS' MinuteClinics, guiding discharged hospital patients through their at-home plans and managing complex conditions.

From there, CVS will evaluate and tweak new store formats as necessary before rolling them out broadly.

""We'll be working hard so those opportunities will be coming as soon as possible,"" he said.

The two companies announced the deal in December 2017 and received preliminary approval from the Department of Justice in October. CVS needed final approval from state insurance regulators where Aetna sells its coverage. A handful of states opposed the combination, saying it would reduce competition and could leave consumers worse off.

In the end, CVS was able to persuade the state regulators to sign off on the acquisition. To win approval from California, CVS agreed to a number of conditions, including not raising premiums as a result of acquisition costs and keeping premium increases to a minimum. This came after Aetna said it would sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans for an undisclosed amount in order ease concerns about the overlap between the CVS and Aetna Medicare Part D plans.

On its third-quarter earnings call Nov. 6, CVS said it expects to save more than $750 million within two years of the deal closing. Merlo has promised the combined company will create a new data-driven health-care model that's more personal, convenient and tailored to individual patients than ever before.","Larry Merlo, CEO of CVS and Mark Bertolini, CEO of AETNA appear on Squawk Box on Dec. 4th, 2017.

""Today marks the start of a new day in health care and a transformative moment for our company and our industry,"" declared CVS Health President and Chief Executive Officer Larry J. Merlo. ""By delivering the combined capabilities of our two leading organizations, we will transform the consumer health experience and build healthier communities through a new innovative health care model that is local, easier to use, less expensive and puts consumers at the center of their care.""

Added Merlo, ""As the front door to quality health care, our combined company will have a community focus, engaging consumers with the care they need when and where they need it, will simplify a complicated system and will help people achieve better health at a lower cost. We are also leading change in health care by challenging the status quo with new technologies, business models and partnerships. In doing so, we will continue to deliver on our purpose of helping people on their path to better health.""

The combined company will connect consumers with the powerful health resources of CVS Health in communities across the country and Aetna's network of providers to help remove barriers to high quality care and build lasting relationships with consumers, making it easier for consumers to access the information, resources and services they need to achieve their best health.

Access is a critical component of building a simpler and more responsive and affordable health care experience for consumers. New products and services developed by the combined company will be broadly available to the health care marketplace, regardless of one's insurer, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) or pharmacy of choice. Additionally, CVS Health offerings, including retail pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy and long-term care, walk-in clinical services and PBM services, will continue to be fully accessible to other health plans. Aetna members will also continue to have a broad network of pharmacies, including community-based independent pharmacies, available to fill their prescriptions. CVS Pharmacy will continue to participate within the pharmacy networks for other PBMs and health plans.

""By fully integrating Aetna's medical information and analytics with CVS Health's pharmacy data, we can develop new ways to engage consumers in their total health and wellness through personal contacts and deeper collaboration with their primary care physicians,"" Merlo said. ""As a result, we expect patients will benefit from earlier interventions and better-connected care, leading to improved health outcomes and lower medical costs.""

Coordination among physicians, other health care providers and caregivers, and the health care professionals at CVS Health, combined with expanded health screenings and advanced connected devices, can help providers predict and prevent major health events before they occur by, for example, identifying pre-diabetes symptoms or the warning signs of a heart attack. This will be done by remotely monitoring key health vitals or helping to ensure patients with chronic diseases take their medications as prescribed, which can improve patient health and avoid costly adverse events.

""Health care delivery is changing before our eyes and we are excited to be in the vanguard of that change. With a physical presence in almost every community across the country, we have the unmatched ability to meet consumers where they are and provide the care and services they need either face-to-face or with the unique set of virtual and physical delivery service capabilities that extends our physical presence in real-time to meet their needs,"" said Merlo.

First Phase of New Programs and Services for Consumers Getting Underway

CVS Health has begun to put the foundational pieces of its new health care model in place and, in the coming months, will introduce new programs and services designed to increase access to care, improve health outcomes and reduce medical costs for all consumers. In particular, these programs will target better, more efficient management of chronic disease using the networks, technology and the people of the combined company.

Enhanced health services in the community will include a range of services focused on self-management for patients with chronic conditions, expansion of services at MinuteClinic, nutritional and behavioral counseling and benefit navigation support, as well as assistance with durable medical equipment, digital health apps and connected devices.

Among other activities, CVS Health will build on its successful Project Health screening events at CVS Pharmacy and Aetna's commitment to building healthier communities to offer new preventive health screenings in communities that are identified as high-risk for certain health challenges. These community-based programs will aim to improve patients' health outcomes through expanded preventive health screenings and support in the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases that can be effectively treated with prescription drugs and enhanced care management, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. CVS Health will work with local community partners to provide patients who are diagnosed for the first time with the follow up they need. To support these communities and newly diagnosed patients, MinuteClinic will also be introducing newly expanded chronic care management services.

Additionally, CVS Health is developing innovative new medical cost reduction programs to improve medication adherence and avoid hospital readmissions and unnecessary emergency room visits. This will include timelier and more comprehensive medication reviews as well as expanded services and hours at select MinuteClinic locations to reduce inappropriate emergency room use.

Transaction and Closing Details

Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Aetna common stock is being exchanged for $145.00 in cash and 0.8378 shares of CVS Health common stock. CVS Health is not issuing any fractional shares in the transaction. Instead, the total number of shares of CVS Health common stock that each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive is being rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive cash for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that the Aetna shareholder is otherwise entitled to receive.

The transaction values Aetna at $212 per share or approximately $70 billion. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, the total value of the transaction is $78 billion. The combined company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""CVS."" The Aetna brand name will continue to be used in reference to the health insurance products. Going forward, Aetna will operate as a stand-alone business within the CVS Health enterprise and will be led by members of its current management team.

As a result of the acquisition, shareholders are expected to benefit from a number of outcomes, including enhanced competitive positioning; the delivery of more than $750 million in synergies in 2020; and a platform from which to accelerate growth. The roadmap for value creation over the longer term has the potential to deliver substantial incremental value through the development of products and services that provide the opportunity to generate significant new growth opportunities aimed at reducing medical costs, growing membership and enhancing revenues.

CVS Health funded the cash portion of the acquisition through existing cash on hand and debt financing. In anticipation of the closing of the acquisition, in March 2018, CVS Health issued an aggregate of $40 billion of unsecured senior notes at a favorable, weighted-average blended rate of approximately 4.19%. The notes have maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. Additionally, in December 2017, CVS Health entered into a $5 billion unsecured term loan agreement. The term loan facility under the term loan agreement consists of a $3 billion three-year tranche and a $2 billion five-year tranche. The term loan facility allows for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company's debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly commitment fee, regardless of usage.

In connection with the acquisition, on October 10, 2018, CVS Health announced that it had entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that allowed it to proceed with the acquisition of Aetna. As part of the agreement reached with the DOJ, Aetna entered into an asset purchase agreement with a subsidiary of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE: WCG) for the divestiture of Aetna's stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, which have an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million members. The divestiture transaction is expected to close within the next few business days. Aetna will provide administrative services to and will retain the financial results of the divested plans through 2019. The acquisition of Aetna was also subject to certain state regulatory approvals which have all now been obtained.

I'm often skeptical when companies make big acquisitions, and for good reason. Study after study shows that mergers and acquisitions destroy value for shareholders somewhere between 70%-90% of the time. Misaligned incentives often encourage companies to overpay for businesses on the premise of “combined synergies” that never materialize.

However, this firm has shown an ability to create value through acquisitions in its past, and I expect it to succeed with its upcoming acquisition as well.

Real potential synergies from vertical integration, a reasonably valued purchase price, and corporate governance that aligns with shareholder’s interests makes CVS Health (CVS) this week’s Long Idea.

Track Record of Value-Creating Acquisitions

CVS recently won approval from the Department of Justice for its proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna (AET). The merger will turn CVS into a vertically integrated healthcare provider that buys pharmaceuticals through its Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) business, insures patients through Aetna, and dispenses drugs and provides treatment at its drugstores and MinuteClinics.

Many companies struggle to integrate large acquisitions, but CVS has demonstrated its ability to succeed with large vertical integrations in the past. In 2007, CVS – which was at the time primarily just a drugstore chain – acquired Caremark, one of the largest PBM’s in the US.

CVS’ stock dropped when it announced the deal as investors were skeptical of the proposed synergies. However, Figure 1 shows that in the decade since the merger was completed, CVS has increased its economic earnings – the true cash flows of the business – from -$230 million to $3.5 billion.

Figure 1: CVS’s Economic Earnings and GAAP Net Income Since 2007

New Constructs, LLC

GAAP earnings understate the increase in CVS’ profitability since the Caremark acquisition as well. Specifically, a $3.9 billion (2% of revenue) non-cash write-down earlier this year artificially decreased trailing twelve months (TTM) GAAP net income.

Management Incentives Are Aligned with Shareholders

As I discussed in the intro to this piece, many acquisitions fail because executive interests are not aligned with the real driver of shareholder value: return on invested capital (ROIC). When executive’s bonuses are tied to metrics such as GAAP earnings or EBITDA, they might pursue acquisitions that improve those metrics but hurt ROIC.

CVS does not tie executive compensation directly to ROIC, but it does use a similar metric, Return on Net Assets (RoNA). RoNA uses net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) as the numerator, just like ROIC, but it uses Adjusted Average Net Assets as the denominator. Adjusted Average Net Assets is similar to my Invested Capital metric, but it does not make many of the adjustments I do for items such as off-balance sheet debt, accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred compensation and others.

CVS would be better off using ROIC, but RoNA at least incentivizes executives to pay attention to capital allocation. The fact that long-term stock grants are tied to RoNA should give investors confidence that executives have the right interests (shareholders’) at heart when it comes to this acquisition.

The Price Is Right

The other reason most acquisitions fail is that acquiring companies almost always overpay. A high price tag can doom a deal from the start, even if the two companies integrate seamlessly and have significant synergies.

Fortunately, CVS does not appear to be overpaying for Aetna. At the acquisition price of $207/share, CVS will invest ~$79 billion (when accounting for debt and other liabilities) to gain ~$4 billion in TTM NOPAT, which means the deal earns an ROIC of 5.1%.

CVS has a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.3%, so even without synergies this deal should be accretive to economic earnings. As Figure 2 shows, it won’t take much growth in profitability for the Aetna acquisition to meet or even exceed CVS’s current ROIC of 7.8%. If Aetna can maintain TTM margins of 6.7% and grow revenue by 6% compounded annually for seven years (roughly in line with projected healthcare spending growth), the acquisition will earn a 7.8% ROIC.

Figure 2: Implied Acquisition ROIC’s Based on Growth Scenarios

New Constructs, LLC

If the impact of vertical integration can help Aetna gain market share and grow revenue by 10% compounded annually for five years, the deal could earn an ROIC of 9.1%, higher than CVS’s current ROIC and more than double its WACC.

Skeptics will argue that Aetna’s margins have been unusually high in the TTM period and should regress, but even if pre-tax margins decline, the impact of the tax cut – which reduced its effective tax rate from 35% to 27% – should allow it to maintain current after-tax margins.

Vertical Integration Creates Significant Advantages

Once CVS completes the Aetna acquisition, it will become the only vertically integrated healthcare company with a major market share in the PBM, health insurance, and retail pharmacy space.

Other competitors have major market shares in two of those three segments. For instance, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is the largest health insurer in the country and its OptumRx business is the third largest PBM, but its pharmacy business is less than a quarter the size of CVS’s. The recently approved Cigna (CI) and Express Scripts (ESRX) merger will create a similar entity with integration in two out of the three points of the chain.

CVS’s unique vertical integration means it will be managing patient’s health from the backend of purchasing drugs all the way to the point of contact. This integration provides a number of significant advantages, including:

Aligning Incentives: Misaligned incentives represent one of the largest inefficiencies in the current pharmaceutical value chain. PBM’s earn a significant amount of their revenue in the form of rebates from drug manufacturers, so they sometimes have an incentive to choose more expensive drugs over ones that would be cheaper for insurers and pharmacies. Pharmacies may tend to overprescribe as long as insurers will cover the costs. By putting all three segments under the same umbrella, CVS can focus on aligning everyone’s incentives around providing the best quality care at the cheapest price.

By putting all three segments under the same umbrella, CVS can focus on aligning everyone’s incentives around providing the best quality care at the cheapest price. Superior Data: Post acquisition, the company will have data about patients’ claims history, pharmacy usage, prescription data, and many more data points that it can combine to get a more complete picture of patient care. In the past, these datasets may have been siloed, or even if they were shared, they would use different nomenclatures or structures that made cross analysis impractical.

In the past, these datasets may have been siloed, or even if they were shared, they would use different nomenclatures or structures that made cross analysis impractical. Retail Sales: Even outside of the healthcare space, this deal could provide a boost to CVS’s retail operation, which brings in ~$20 billion in revenue annually (11% of total revenue) and has a higher margin than the rest of the business. If CVS provides incentives for Aetna customers to pick up their prescriptions in its pharmacies, those customers might also pick up some groceries, beauty products, or other small items while they’re in the store.

The first two advantages – aligning incentives and aggregating data across business units – should allow CVS to provide a higher quality of care at a lower price. They give CVS unique capabilities versus existing competitors and potential new entrants into the industry.

The third advantage enables CVS to make more money and serve more customers than standalone insurers/PBM’s or online only pharmacies. The incremental value of retail revenue and touch points can subsidize healthcare costs and allow CVS/Aetna to offer more competitive premiums and prescription prices.

Threat from Amazon Is Overhyped

Amazon (AMZN) has been the looming threat in the pharmacy industry over the past two years. The e-commerce giant continues to make noise about potential plans to enter the pharmacy space. CVS stock dropped 8% in June after Amazon announced its acquisition of online pharmacy startup PillPack.

While no one wants to compete with Amazon, I’ve argued in my micro-bubble piece that its power to disrupt industries has been overhyped. Many brick and mortar retailers continue to thrive, and the barriers to entry in the pharmacy space are significantly higher.

For starters, Amazon’s biggest impact was on poorly run retailers – such as Sears (SHLD) – that underinvested in their stores and created a poor shopping experience. There doesn’t appear to be that same low-hanging fruit in the pharmacy industry, as brick-and-mortar pharmacies have some of the highest customer satisfaction scores of any industry.

In addition, physical locations provide a significant advantage for pharmacies. They allow patients to pick up prescriptions immediately rather than have to wait for delivery, and they can also provide simple forms of preventative care like screening and vaccinations. While Amazon does have some brick-and-mortar locations with its acquisition of Whole Foods, its roughly 500 locations pale in comparison to CVS’s ~9,800.

Finally, CVS’ back-end integrations give it an advantage that will be difficult to replicate. Amazon’s supply-chain expertise may translate to the pharmacy space, but it has no real experience or advantage that would allow it to compete in the insurance or PBM space. The same goes for other retailers such as Walmart (WMT) that have considered moving more heavily into the healthcare industry.

Improving ROIC Correlated with Creating Shareholder Value

Numerous case studies show that getting ROIC right is an important part of making smart investments. Ernst & Young recently published a white paper that proves the material superiority of my firm's forensic accounting research and measure of ROIC. The technology that enables this research is featured by Harvard Business School.

Per Figure 3, ROIC explains 60% of the difference in valuation for the 7 pharmacies/PBM’s under coverage. CVS’s stock trades at a significant discount to peers as shown by its position below the trendline.

Figure 3: ROIC Explains 60% Of Valuation for Pharmacies and PBM’s

New Constructs, LLC

If the stock were to trade at parity with its peer group, it would be worth $122/share – a 54% upside to the current stock price. This is not a perfect peer group since CVS’s business is fairly unique, so it might deserve to trade at a discount compared to a company with more of a health insurance focus like UNH in the top right corner. Still, it’s hard to believe that CVS deserves to trade this far below its peers.

CVS Is Priced for 30% Profit Decline

Despite the strong fundamentals, CVS remains cheap, even though traditional metrics would show otherwise. At its current price of $79/share, CVS has a P/E ratio of 25, roughly in line with the S&P 500. As we noted above, CVS’s GAAP earnings understate its true profitability.

When I analyze the cash flow expectations baked into the stock price, I find that CVS is significantly undervalued. At its current price of $79/share, CVS has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.7. This ratio means the market expects CVS’s NOPAT to permanently decline by 30%.

This expectation seems rather pessimistic given that CVS has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually over the past decade.

Such pessimistic expectations create large upside potential. If one assumes that CVS can successfully integrate the Aetna acquisition next year, maintain 2017 pre-tax margins of 6%, and grow revenue at a long-term rate of 3.5% compounded annually for 10 years, the stock is worth $195/share today, a 147% upside from the current price. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.

That may seem like a wildly optimistic price target, but it doesn’t require a major improvement in CVS’s business. In fact, in that DCF scenario the company has the same ROIC in year 10, 7.8%, that it has today.

What Noise Traders Miss with CVS

In general, today’s markets tend to overlook intelligent capital allocation and shareholder-friendly corporate governance. Instead, due to the proliferation of noise traders, markets are great at amplifying risk as momentum stocks get pushed higher and high-quality fundamental research is downplayed. Here are just a few points that noise traders would miss when analyzing CVS:

Long-term profit growth – GAAP earnings understate the company’s profit growth since the Caremark acquisition.

Competitive advantage – Noise traders fall prey to the “Amazon effect” and assume CVS is doomed if Amazon enters its industry. In this way, it’s similar to some of our micro-bubble winners.

Undervalued stock price – CVS’s P/E ratio looks average relative to the overall market, but as we know, P/E ratios are not a good measure of value.

Acquisition Growth Can Send Shares Higher

As the title of this piece states, we see the Aetna acquisition as the primary catalyst for CVS. The deal should boost economic earnings immediately, and it could deliver significant synergies in the near-term. The combined company could certainly beat analyst earnings expectations, which should send shares higher.

Longer term, the company should see its PEBV grow as its advantages and resilience to competition become more apparent. If the market gives the company a PEBV of 1.2 – like it had in 2014 before the Amazon threat was as pronounced – that would provide significant upside even without any profit growth.

Tax Reform Should Provide a Boost

CVS stands to benefit to an unusually large degree from the corporate tax cuts. It pays an unusually high cash tax rate of 38%, and it earns substantially all of its revenue within the U.S. The company expects its effective tax rate to fall to 27% in 2018, which would boost NOPAT by ~$1.2 billion (18%).

As noted above, Aetna should also get a significant boost from the corporate tax cuts. This increased cash flow should help the combined company invest in the data and back-end infrastructure it needs to successfully integrate its businesses while also potentially returning more capital to shareholders.

Dividend Offers Safe 2.7%

CVS has increased its dividend in each of the past 15 years, although that streak will end this year as the company has frozen its dividend in advance of the Aetna merger. Its annualized dividend has grown from $0.50/share in 2011 to $2.00/share in 2017, or 26% compounded annually. The current dividend provides a 2.7% yield. Best of all, CVS generates the necessary cash flow to continue paying its dividend. Since 2011, CVS has generated a cumulative $22.7 billion (30% of market cap) in free cash flow while paying about $9.4 billion in dividends.

In addition to dividends, CVS has the ability to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Over the past several years, the company has bought back $4-$5 billion in shares each year. However, with the added debt from the Aetna acquisition, the company plans to suspend buyback activity until it can reduce its leverage ratio after the acquisition is completed. If the company eventually resumes buying back stock at the same rate, the combined buybacks and dividend will offer ~8.6% yield.

Insider Trading and Short Interest Are Minimal

Insider activity has been minimal over the past 12 months, with 97 thousand shares purchased and 200 thousand shares sold for a net effect of 103 thousand shares sold. These sales represent less than 1% of shares outstanding.

There are currently 58.5 million shares sold short, which equates to 6% of shares outstanding and 7.3 days to cover. The days to cover number is slightly high, but that reflects relatively low trading volumes more than high short interest.

Critical Details Found in Financial Filings by my Firm's Robo-Analyst Technology

As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings. Below are specifics on the adjustments I make based on Robo-Analyst[1] findings in CVS Health’s fiscal 2017 10-K:

Income Statement: I made $5.5 billion of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $250 million in non-operating expense (1% of revenue). I removed $2.6 billion in non-operating income and $2.9 billion in non-operating expenses. You can see all the adjustments made to CVS’s income statement here.

Balance Sheet: I made $26.9 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $26.9 billion. The most notable adjustment was $19.5 million in operating leases. This adjustment represented 30% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to CVS’s balance sheet here.

Valuation: I made $122 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $53 billion. Despite this decrease in shareholder value, CVS remains undervalued.

Attractive Funds That Hold CVS

The following funds receive an attractive-or-better rating and allocate significantly to CVS Health.

iShares US Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF) – 6.7% allocation and attractive rating. Ivy Focused Value NextShares (IVFVC) – 4.9% allocation and very attractive rating.

Wall Street analysts had expected antitrust approval as the companies have little overlap in their businesses. The decision bodes well for the pending U.S. antitrust review of CVS Health Corp's CVS.N proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.

The new company will marry Cigna's business of managing health plans for corporations and the government with Express Scripts' ESRX.O role handling pharmacy benefits for those same customers. Express Scripts also owns specialty pharmacies that distribute pricey drugs.

“We are pleased that the Department of Justice has cleared our transaction and that we are another step closer to completing our merger,” Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in a statement.

The Justice Department review of CVS’s planned purchase of Aetna may conclude this month, but will take longer because of divestitures needed to resolve competitive concerns, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the company continues to expect to close its deal late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, a forecast it gave investors on Aug. 8 during a conference call.

The Justice Department in 2016 successfully blocked a pair of large health insurance mergers it believed would limit competition in the industry. Those were Aetna's plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurer Humana Inc HUM.N for $37 billion, and a planned $54 billion combination of insurers Anthem Inc ANTM.N and Cigna.

Aetna and Cigna, however, were determined to seek growth through deals while responding to a changing healthcare landscape, eventually targeting mergers with the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).

“We believe these two transactions add more pressure on Humana to move further down the path of vertical integration,” William Blair analyst John Kreger said. “We suspect other health plans will look to follow suit.”

FEELING THE PRESSURE

Antitrust experts have described the current deals as vertical combinations that present fewer issues than the failed insurer mergers. That view was bolstered after the Justice Department lost its case to stop AT&T's T.N acquisition of media company Time Warner. The department is appealing the decision.

“Everyone is feeling the pressure right now ... to react to disruption in the healthcare industry,” said Brad Haller, a director in West Monroe Partners’ mergers & acquisitions practice.

That disruption includes Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O moves into healthcare. The world's largest online retailer purchased online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it undercut traditional prescription drug sales.

Amazon has also aligned itself with JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N to experiment with new business models for employee healthcare - one of Cigna's target markets.

Cigna’s purchase of Express Scripts comes as PBMs’ role in prescription drug costs has come under scrutiny.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said it is looking at how so-called industry middlemen and pharmacies such as Express Scripts and CVS impact drug costs for U.S. consumers. The administration is looking at implementing a rule that could change or eliminate the use of rebates from drugmakers to PBMs that critics say contribute to higher drug prices.

Cigna and Express Scripts said they have already obtained clearances for the deal from departments of insurance in 16 states and are working with regulators in remaining jurisdictions to obtain clearance for the merger.

“States could still conduct a public hearing ... though it is very unlikely that they do not align with the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision,” Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said.

9,"Oct 29, 2017",MarketWatch,CVS-Aetna merger ‘makes a lot of sense’ as Amazon enters market — analysts assess the deal talk,"The proposed merger between CVS Health Corp. and Aetna Inc. is not a done deal yet, but analysts are already cheering the prospects of the two health care giants teaming up against increased competition, including the new threat from Amazon.com Inc.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that CVS CVS, -0.93% is in talks with Aetna US:AET and has offered to buy the health insurer for more than $200 per share, which would value the company at more than $66 billion.

Shares of Aetna rallied 12% after the reports, while CVS closed 2.9% lower on Thursday. CVS shares fell 3.5% in early trade Friday, while Aetna slid 0.3%.

According to the WSJ sources, the merger proposal was spurred by expectations that Amazon AMZN, -0.05% would enter the pharmacy business.

That concern that was underscored on Thursday by reports Amazon has obtained approval to become a wholesale pharmaceutical distributor in a number of states. Such a move is expected to pressure a wide range of industry players, including drug wholesalers, pharmacy chains and pharmacy-benefit managers, middlemen that negotiate drug prices.

A tie-up between a retailer like CVS and a health insurer like Aetna may seem surprising on the surface. But experts say both parties need to make strategic moves to address the changes in the sector, including the possible threat from juggernaut Amazon.

Here’s what analysts are saying about the prospects for a merged company:

• “We would view a deal with Aetna positively for CVS from a strategic standpoint. We believe it would enable CVS to touch more health care spend and create more value for stakeholders, and while many payors are struggling with engaging patients, CVS owns that patient touch point through its retail pharmacy footprint.

“Pharmacy is generally the most frequently used health benefit, with many patients picking up prescriptions on a monthly basis, far more frequently than patients visit their physician. CVS could potentially use this platform and its broad suite of services across the care continuum as a means to more effectively engage patients in a more holistic manner and potentially drive lower overall health care costs.

“Importantly, at this point, we would not expect a competing bidder to emerge given the size of both companies.”

— Lisa Gill, analyst, J.P. Morgan

Aetna CEO: Why the Merger With Humana Fell Apart

• “CVS clearly needs a strategic response to the onslaught of the captive [pharmacy-benefit managers] which are turning into fierce competitors from customers.

“Amazon’s speculated entry into the Drug Value Chain is becoming more real, with wholesale pharmacy licenses in over 12 states and a massive threat to CVS across the lucrative $560 billion prescription pharmaceutical market, and the associated and already dwindling front store sales.”

“[The] Aetna management is dealing with its own growth challenges and needs to re-invent its business model with the likes of CVS.”

— Ana Gupte, managing director for health care services at Leerink

• “We think a CVS/AET combination makes a lot of sense... Similar to formulary management in pharmacy, this type of partnership between a retail pharmacy and a managed care company could be the next generation of formulary management in health care services. ER expenses are massive for managed care companies, and a lot of non-acute cases are treated in this setting unnecessarily.”

— Mizuho Securities analysts

• “This transaction is exactly in line with our investment thesis, and we believe the combined company would be a behemoth in the future of consumer oriented vertically integrated care delivery, while at the same time diversifying CVS away from parts of its business most susceptible to competition from Amazon.”

— RBC Capital Markets analysts

• “A CVS acquisition of Aetna should not come as a complete surprise... Given [UnitedHealth’s] success with OptumRx—as well as intensifying or emerging themes in health care such as consumerism, accessibility, comprehensive care coordination, and overall cost reduction—we see the potential combination of CVS and AET as a logical progression of the two companies’ relationship.”

— Jefferies analysts

• “While obviously the terms of any potential deal would be key, we think the combination would make sense, like the strategic rationale and view the existing relationship as an attractive facilitator.”

“We view any potential transaction as further diversifying CVS’ business, decreasing overall company exposure to a challenging retail pharmacy environment and positioning the company well in a health care environment increasingly moving towards integrated management of both medical and pharmacy costs.”

Almost a year after it was announced, CVS Health has officially on its deal to acquire the health insurer Aetna.

The two companies got the go-ahead from the Department of Justice for their deal in October, but they still needed key state insurance agencies to sign off. CVS Health on Monday morning said the two companies had received approval from all regulators and expected to complete the transaction by Wednesday.

CVS said Wednesday that the transaction values Aetna at $212 a share, or $70 billion. All-in, including Aetna's debt, the total value of the deal is $78 billion.

As part of the deal closing, the state of New York imposed certain conditions to CVS geared at protecting consumers, including not allowing the transaction to be paid for by Aetna companies covering New Yorkers as well as committing $40 million to the state to support health-insurance education efforts.

The deal will redraw the healthcare industry.

As part of the agreement with the DOJ, CVS and Aetna have to divest Aetna's Medicare Part D prescription-drug-plan business.

The boundaries of the healthcare business are changing. Instead of growing by acquiring other companies in the same business, companies have started to move into new lines of business, with no two combinations looking exactly the same.

It's part of a push by healthcare companies to both cut costs and gain more control over the patients in need of their services. It's coming as large tech companies seek ways to disrupt the healthcare industry and as new medications challenge the way we pay for treatments.

11,"Mar 8, 2018",,What merger mania means for health care,"Get ready for another wave of massive health care deals -- and maybe this time the government will approve them.

Health insurer giant Cigna's proposed purchase of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts for $67 billion comes just three months after Cigna rival Aetna agreed to be bought by drugstore chain CVS (CVS) for $69 billion.

The insurance companies have been forced to find alternative ways to adapt and grow in a rapidly changing health care industry after the Justice Department blocked two massive deals involving four of the five biggest health insurers on antitrust grounds a year ago.

Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM) called off their proposed combination in February 2017 -- and rivals Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) announced they were ending plans to merge on the same day. UnitedHealth (UNH) is the other major health care insurer.

But the Cigna-Express Scripts and CVS-Aetna deals, in theory, have a better chance of getting approved by regulators since they are so-called vertical, as opposed to horizontal, mergers.

In plain English, that means the mergers aren't ones where two similar companies are looking to combine and take a competitor out of the market. Instead, they're trying to add a new line of business.

Still, the deal between Cigna and Express Scripts (ESRX) is yet another clear sign that the health care industry in America could soon be dominated by just a small handful of giant conglomerates.

For example, the pharmacy benefits management industry, which negotiates with the big drug makers to try and get better prices on prescription medications for consumers, is already dominated by Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth.

If CVS gets approval to buy Aetna, that means it will own a giant pharmacy chain, an insurer and a company that helps set the prices of the drugs that will be sold in CVS stores -- that many customers will use Aetna insurance to pay for.

Whew. So it's unclear if antitrust regulators will greenlight this deal -- or the Cigna-Express Scripts combination. But don't be surprised if more health care companies succumb to the urge to merge as well, even as they wait for signs from Washington.

Walgreens (WBA), which recently agreed to buy a big chunk of stores from rival Rite Aid (RAD), could potentially counter the CVS-Aertna deal with an acquisition of its own. That may put Humana and Anthem in play.

Walmart (WMT) also operates a giant pharmacy business of its own and may feel the need to bulk up in the health care business.

Related: Jeff Bezos and his two friends just spooked the health care industry

A lot has changed in the health care world in the three months since CVS announced the Aetna purchase.

President Trump and Republicans in Congress have taken several steps to neuter much of the Affordable Care Act legislation that was a hallmark of the Obama administration. That has many people worried about rising health care costs once again.

There is also now looming competition in the insurance business from three American corporate titans -- Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

The CEOs of the three giants -- Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon -- announced in late January that they planned to start a yet-to-be-named insurance company for their employees that would be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""

The companies didn't provide many details about how the insurer would differ from other health care insurers. But the line about ""being free from profit-making incentives"" sounds like these companies want to do their best to keep prices low for their workers.

Investors seem to be betting that all of this competition will lead to more consolidation throughout the health care food chain as well. Shares of drug distributors McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) all rose modestly Thursday.

But Humana and Anthem were slightly lower. Wall Street may be viewing them as the odd men out unless they soon decide to make a move that counters the ones made by their top rivals.","Get ready for another wave of massive health care deals -- and maybe this time the government will approve them.

But more than that, CVS’s CVS, -0.93% many locations can be leveraged to reach out into the community, where most of consumer health is determined, Aetna US:AET Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said on Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal Health Forum in Washington, D.C., including supporting diet and exercise efforts and patients with chronic diseases.

Bertolini, who has previously compared this goal to Apple’s AAPL, +0.81% Genius Bar, said CVS stores and services could become a “tent without walls,” by say, encouraging an individual with Type 1 diabetes named Sally to exercise a certain amount and keep her hemoglobin levels below a certain point.

The deal could also result in a “REI-like capability for people needing durable medical equipment,” Bertolini said, referring to the outdoor retailer that operates as a co-op, noting that the average wait time for a standard wheelchair is three to four months.

“Forget the MinuteClinic. It’s not about the Minute Clinic,” Bertolini said. “It’s really about a place in the store where you can come in” and have health care solutions personalized for you.

The drugstore chain and pharmacy-benefit manager CVS, -0.93% said in December that it had reached an agreement to acquire health insurer Aetna US:AET for about $69 billion, in a deal expected to mark a shift away from pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, which negotiate drug prices and have long been a feature of America’s health-care system.

Read now:U.S. health care is changing in a big way — and the CVS-Aetna deal shows how

Regulators are not expected to approve the deal until later in the year, but CVS is understood to be moving ahead with the acquisition financing to get ahead of higher interest rates expected later in the year, which would make the takeover more expensive.

Moody’s Investors Service assigned a Baa1 rating to the deal and said it remains on review for downgrade, given how much debt it will add to CVS’s balance sheet. A downgrade would push the rating closer to speculative-grade, or “junk,” status, raising borrowing costs.

“The combination of CVS and Aetna will create a one-of-a-kind vertically integrated health-care company with huge scale and mark an industry shift toward a more seamless approach to managing health-care costs as it brings together the overall management of a patient’s medical bills and prescription drugs under one umbrella,” Moody’s Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a note. “However, the transaction will result in significant weakening of CVS’s credit metrics as it will be financed with a large amount of debt and will come with high execution and integration risks.”

CVS to acquire health insurer Aetna

Moody’s is expecting that if the deal is approved based on current terms, and CVS commits to maintaining a strong investment-grade capital structure, it will still lower the rating by one notch to Baa2 with a negative outlook. That would place it just two notches above junk.

The deal comprised nine tranches of two-year fixed and floating-rate notes, three-year fixed and floating rate notes, five-year, seven-year, 10-year, 20-year and 30-year fixed-rate notes, pricing at the tight end of guidance, according to CreditSights.

CreditSight analysts said they are looking for the deal to offer at least 10 to 20 basis points of yield above peer Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -0.53% to offer value, and said the pricing showed that level of spread across most of the curve.

“We would be buyers of the new deal,” said analyst James Goldstein.

For those investors concerned about integration risk, “there is ample opportunity in the short end of the curve—with the two-year notes likely to see just over a year of “action” in the higher-leverage integration period assuming the deal closes at the end of 2018.”

Still, Goldstein noted that leverage will jump more than a turn and a half to 4.6 times once the deal closes.

In its bond prospectus, CVS offered an aggressive plan to reduce leverage to 3.5 times lease adjusted leverage within two years of the deal’s closing. Cash flow that was intended for shareholder returns will be redirected toward debt reduction, along with some of the company’s expected savings from the recent U.S. tax overhaul.

“However, we see a need for an additional roughly $2 billion a year of debt pay-down to support reaching the target without aggressive underlying [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] growth,” CreditSights analyst James Goldstein wrote in a research note before the deal priced on Tuesday.

If the deal falls through, CVS will redeem most of the debt. The Justice Department has not been vocal about its views on the deal, although other signals from Washington suggest it will not meet with too much political resistance, said Goldstein.

CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS) received a big vote of confidence from two key executives this month, when company chairman David Dorman and director C. David Brown II purchased $2.1 million worth of CVS shares, at $62 per share.

The insider stock purchase comes at a time when CVS is at something of a crossroads.

Some traders viewed CVS stock with skepticism, especially after Amazon.com (AMZN) expressed interest in competing with CVS on the prescription drug distribution front. In addition, its upcoming merger with health insurer Aetna (AET) has fueled uncertainty among investors over the combined company's profit picture and its intent to freeze dividend payments until the combined company's debt picture is healthier.

On the other side of the coin, CVS is widely viewed as a well-run company, with robust earnings and a healthy upside as the baby boomers hit retirement age and hike demand for the products and services that CVS provides.

CVS stock at a glance. Despite languishing at $62 per share in early May, it's worth noting that the CVS share price has crested $83 per share in each of the past five years and there's no shortage of analysts who say the same thing can happen in 2018.

An assessment from a group of analysts covering the company pegs CVS's one-year target estimate at $87 per share. The health care and pharmacy giant saw healthy gains in April after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) put off plans to get involved in health care product delivery.

Additionally, CVS hiked its 2017 revenue growth target to 1.5 to 3 percent, up from 0.25 to 2 percent, based on solid first-quarter earnings. The tax reform bill passed by Congress is also lifting CVS's financial fortunes. Company financial officers say they expect adjusted earnings to rise by 21 percent, thanks to a lower tax burden for the company.

Pros to buying CVS stock. If you believe the merger between CVS and Aetna is a good fit, then CVS could be for you.

""The CVS and Aetna deal signifies the next chapter in the consumerism of health care, taking significant steps toward a single-payer system,"" says Grant Geiger, founder and CEO of New York-based EIR Healthcare, a health care technology company. ""This is a shot across the bow to health care providers, hospitals and health systems, disrupting the traditional ecosystem.""

The merger reveals the potential power of a combined CVS-Aetna partnership, Geiger says.

""You look at the controlling position companies like CVS Health, who are negotiating drug discounts on the back end, and how that factors into the health care equation,"" he says. ""Along with the pharmacy benefit managers and payers, CVS has played a role in driving up drug costs to consumers.

""Investors can anticipate that the integration of CVS and Aetna will pose a direct threat to urgent care, minute clinics, independent pharmacies, as well as the outpatient and micro-hospitals we see today,"" he says. ""Providers will have to stop and think twice about their strategic planning process.""

CVS has popped a few more logs into the fire recently as well.

""I see a large rise in CVS Health stock on the horizon,"" says Kenneth Colon, CEO of Izzy Care, a provider of a next-generation AI-driven, tokenized digital health and wellness platform. ""At The Future of Healthcare conference in Las Vegas, we saw Dr. [Troy] Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS, announce how the company plans to leverage the close proximity of CVS retail outlets to consumers, provide data-driven insights for population health, and generate closer collaboration with patient's existing doctors, to improve outcomes.""

Cons to buying CVS stock. Other Wall Street insiders say that CVS, as it stands right now, could be less than a safe bet for investors.

""I would not be a buyer of CVS – there is too much risk at this point,"" says Marc Lichtenfeld, chief income strategist at The Oxford Club. ""While it's a well-managed company and its finances are fine, CVS is not simply the neighborhood drugstore where you go to pick up your prescriptions, some shampoo and maybe a bag of Hershey's kisses that are on sale near the register.""

Lichtenfeld notes that investors need to weigh the fact that the company is in the process of acquiring Aetna, which is an entirely new business for CVS.

""Additionally, CVS runs one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBM) in the country,"" he adds. ""PBMs are under increased scrutiny by the government and may become a target in the government's attempts to lower drug prices.""

Investors need to factor in other warning signs on CVS as well.

""Late-cycle deals of this size are always a concern for acquirers,"" says James Stefurak, founder of Monarch Financial Research, in Melbourne, Florida. ""The massive borrowing to finance the acquisition could harm CVS shareholders down the road. CVS will likely appease creditors and rating agencies at the expense of shareholder interests.

""I'm also worried CVS will look to dilutive equity offerings for future capital raises,"" he says. ""At the very least, CVS should de-emphasize shareholder-friendly policies like buybacks and dividend increases.""

The bottom line. ""CVS's goal is to reinvent health care, Lichtenfeld says, ""and it may very well do that. But how the Aetna merger will work out is anyone's guess. It could go down as a savvy move, as one of the worst deals in recent memory or anything in between.""","Health care stock experts suggest you keep these facts in mind before buying CVS stock.

At a normally routine hearing last week prior to approving the deal, Judge Richard Leon, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he might put off a decision until the summer or even spike the deal altogether, Reuters reported.

“I was reviewing your motion, which, of course is not opposed. And I kind of got this uneasy feeling that I was being kept in the dark, kind of like a mushroom,” Leon said, noting that the American Medical Association, among others, had objected to the deal. “I’m very concerned, very concerned that you all are proceeding on a rubber-stamp approach to this.”

The companies closed the buyout, announced in December 2017, on Nov. 28. It calls for Aetna stockholders to receive $145 in cash and 0.8378 CVS shares for each AET share, for a total value of $212 per share or roughly $70 billion. Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS is financing the deal with cash on hand and debt, including a $40 billion senior notes offering and a two-tranche term loan of $5 billion. But in order to seal the deal, Aetna had to agree to deal its 2.2-million-member Medicare Part D drug plan to WellCare Health Plans (NYSE:WCG).

17,"Dec 7, 2017",TheHill,Democrats sound alarm over CVS-Aetna deal,"Congressional Democrats are expressing alarm over the proposed merger between CVS Health and a health insurer, fearing it will lead to higher costs and less choice for consumers.

CVS Health, a drug store chain, announced over the weekend that it has agreed to buy Aetna for about $69 billion in what could be, if approved, the largest health insurance deal in U.S. history.

But lawmakers are already raising questions about how the merger could impact consumers if it is approved by the Department of Justice.

“I’m very concerned to see another merger in the U.S. that creates another behemoth industry and that has vertical integration,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenSenate Democrats dial down the Manchin tension The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Alibaba - Democrats still at odds over Biden agenda On The Money — Democrats dig in with Biden agenda in the balance MORE (D-Mass.), referring to an integration of two companies that aren’t direct competitors.

“We already have had great concentration in the pharmaceutical industry, in drug stores around the country and in health insurance. And now to see those two start to join really produces a kind of concentration that cuts down on competition and in the long run tends to drive up prices for consumers,” she said.

The companies argue that they’ll be able to improve health-care outcomes and reduce costs immediately upon integrating.

“We have the ability to begin to bend that cost curve and at the same time help people achieve their best health,” CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo said this week on CNBC.

CVS Health and Aetna have worked together since 2010, but the merger could open a new door for health care in the country, Merlo said on CNBC.

The companies have plans to turn CVS’s 10,000 pharmacies and clinics into community-based sites of care with nurses and other health professionals available to give diagnoses or do lab work.

“It’s really the perfect time to bring these two companies together to create a new health care platform that can be easier to use, less expensive for consumers, and really create a new front door to health care in our country,” Merlo said.

But some aren’t so sure.

David Balto, an antitrust attorney in Washington, said it’s easy to predict the effects of the proposed merger on consumers when you look at CVS’s past acquisitions.

The company’s 2007 merger with Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, led to fewer choices for consumers and drove up prices, he argued.

Pharmacy benefit managers serve as a middleman between insurers and drug companies, working to get the best deal on a prescription.

“It doesn’t take much to predict what CVS is going to do with the acquisition of Aetna,” Balto said.

“It’s going to force consumers into using only CVS, CVS stores or CVS specialty pharmacies for their drugs, and ultimately, consumer health care will be worse, not better,” he said.

Any cost savings produced from the merger, he argues, likely wouldn’t be passed along to the consumer.

CVS and Aetna, meanwhile, argue that the merger would give the company more leverage in negotiations with drug companies on drug prices.

But experts have long criticized pharmacy benefit managers, saying they increase drug costs to raise their profits. Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenSenate Democrats dial down the Manchin tension Senate to try to pass 30-day highway bill Saturday after GOP objection Schumer feels heat to get Manchin and Sinema on board MORE (D-Ore.) said he shared those concerns when it comes to the CVS deal.

“We’re looking at [the merger],” said Wyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. “I’m particularly concerned about what provisions they’re going to have in respect to pharmacy benefit managers. I continue to believe these pharmacy benefit managers, the middle men in American health care, are a key factor in why health care costs go up so dramatically.”

He added: “We don’t know what they put in their pocket and what they put in their consumer’s pocket. I have a lot of questions about that.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Memo: Progressives exult in new-found power Equilibrium/Sustainability — Presented by The American Petroleum Institute — A Nobel for Greta Thunberg? Biden visits Capitol with agenda in the balance MORE (I-Vt.), a vocal opponent of the U.S. health-care system, slammed the proposed merger as a contributor to rising costs.

“This is why we have, by far, the most expensive health care system in the world,” Sanders said in a statement. “It is designed to provide huge profits to insurance companies and drug companies and exorbitant compensation packages to CEOs. Congratulations to Mr. [Mark] Bertolini, the CEO of Aetna. If the proposed merger with CVS goes through, he will reap about $500 million. What a great use of health care dollars! What a system!”

The merger is also drawing attention from Democrats on the House side.

Cory Gardner joins lobbying firm Ex-Rep. John Shimkus joins lobbying firm Lobbying world MORE (R-Ore.) to hold a hearing on the merger.

The merger “would be a new frontier in American health care delivery — with significant potential for benefit or harm to consumers across the country,” Pallone wrote in a letter to Walden.

“As the business of health care continues to morph, it is critical that Congress closely examine the changing relationships among health care entities and the impact these changing relationships have on the way health care is delivered in this country,” Pallone said.

“I can see the pluses, and I can see the minuses,” he said. “I hope we can have a hearing on it because I think it might be a little bit of an example of things to come, and we might want to get into what it means for the health-care system.”

It’s far from certain that the Department of Justice will approve the merger.

18,"Nov 29, 2018",MassDevice,CVS closes $70B Aetna buy,"CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) said yesterday that it closed the $70 billion buyout of health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET).

When the deal was announced in December 2017, the chief executives of CVS and Aetna said that they plan to transform CVS’s pharmacies and clinics into community-based healthcare sites, where people can access care at a more reasonable price than for a visit to the doctor’s office.

“Today marks the start of a new day in health care and a transformative moment for our company and our industry,” CVS Health president & CEO Larry Merlo said in prepared remarks. “By delivering the combined capabilities of our two leading organizations, we will transform the consumer health experience and build healthier communities through a new innovative health care model that is local, easier to use, less expensive and puts consumers at the center of their care.

“By fully integrating Aetna’s medical information and analytics with CVS Health’s pharmacy data, we can develop new ways to engage consumers in their total health and wellness through personal contacts and deeper collaboration with their primary care physicians,” Merlo said. “As a result, we expect patients will benefit from earlier interventions and better-connected care, leading to improved health outcomes and lower medical costs.”

The 10,000 CVS locations across the country provide a strategic advantage in that they’re already available and established within communities, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini told The New York Times late last year.

“CVS has the draw,” Bertolini said. “People trust their pharmacist.”

“We think of it as creating a new front door to healthcare in American,” Merlo added.

The deal calls for Aetna stockholders to receive $145 in cash and 0.8378 CVS shares for each AET share, for a total value of $212 per share or roughly $70 billion, CVS said. The Woonsocket, R.I.-based company said it financed the deal with cash on hand and debt, including a $40 billion senior notes offering and a two-tranche term loan of $5 billion.

19,"Oct 11, 2018",The Motley Fool,Why CVS Health Corporation Stock Is Falling Today,"What happened

Shares of CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) were down 6.7% as of 3:23 p.m. EDT Thursday. Two factors appeared to be behind the pharmacy services stock's decline.

On Wednesday afternoon, CVS Health announced that it had entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that allows it to move forward with its planned acquisition of Aetna (NYSE:AET). Some investors and analysts have expressed reservations about the deal.

Also, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) missed Wall Street revenue expectations with its fiscal Q4 financial results announced before the market opened Thursday. The company, which is CVS Health's largest rival, reported that its sales increased 10.9% to $33.4 billion. Analysts, however, expected Walgreens to post Q4 revenue of $33.78 billion.

So what

The more important news for CVS Health was the DOJ agreement that allows the company to proceed with plans to buy Aetna. This is a big bet that CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo is leading his company into -- a $69 billion bet.

Because of its intention to acquire Aetna, CVS Health has already suspended hikes to its dividend. That's usually a sure-fire way to make investors unhappy. The company is also taking on additional debt to finance the transaction on top of assuming Aetna's $8 billion debt.

There are several potential positives associated with the Aetna deal, though. CVS Health will be the only entity with retail pharmacy, pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), and health insurance businesses. The company thinks that this integration will enable it to improve healthcare for customers and more effectively control costs.

As for Walgreens' revenue miss, the most important thing to note was that same-store retail sales fell 1.9% year over year. Walgreens particularly noted weakness in consumables, general merchandise, and personal care products.

CVS Health posted its own year-over-year decline in same-store front-store sales in the second quarter, due largely to the impact of the timing of Easter. Walgreens' lagging retail sales could be a hint that CVS Health could have another anemic quarter of front-store sales when it announces Q3 results next month.

Now what

The main thing for investors to watch for with CVS Health concerning the Aetna acquisition is how quickly the company lines up regulatory approvals in the remaining states that haven't already given a thumbs-up to the deal. CVS Health expects, though, that the transaction will close relatively quickly.

CVS Health is scheduled to provide its Q3 update on Nov. 6. The company has already lowered earnings expectations for the quarter. Over the long run, investors need to keep their eyes on how effectively CVS Health leverages its integration with Aetna. That will matter a lot more than how well the company performs in one quarter.","What happenedShares of CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) were down 6.7% as of 3:23 p.m. EDT Thursday.

20,"Oct 31, 2017",TheStreet,Aetna Stays Mum on Possible Blockbuster CVS Marriage,"On the heels of a WSJ report on deal discussions between CVS Health and Aetna, executives at Aetna said on an earnings call Tuesday they are not commenting on rumors.

Officials at Aetna Inc. (AET) have a lot of explaining to do, as rumors continue to swirl that the Hartford, Conn.-based insurance giant is in talks to be acquired by pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp. (CVS) - Get CVS Health Corporation Report .

But amid the deal chatter, and after a failed deal with Humana Inc. (HUM) - Get Humana Inc. (HUM) Report in February, executives are focused on earnings, much of which failed to impress investors despite a steep earnings beat.

Aetna on Tuesday reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.45, up 18% from the same period last year. Revenue was $14.99 billion, down 5% year-over-year.

Analysts had forecast, on average, adjusted EPS of $2.08 on revenue of $15.12 billion, according to Bloomberg.

""The EPS beat was 37 [cents] at $2.45 on a modest revenue Miss and driven by favorable MLR [medical loss ratio] performance on Commercial, Govt, Group MLR, SGA & tax rate offset by a modest revenue Miss,"" wrote Leerink Partners LLC analyst Ana Gupte in a note.

Aetna raised its full-year 2017 GAAP EPS outlook to around $5.95 from previous guidance of $5.46 to $5.56. It increased adjusted EPS guidance to around $9.75 from the previously issued range of $9.45 to $9.55.

Shares of Aetna were trading at $169.99 on Tuesday, down nearly 1%, or 74 cents.

Amid chatter on a potential deal between Aetna and CVS, officials at the insurance giant said on an earnings call Tuesday, Oct. 31, they are not commenting on rumors.

""As you are all aware, there has been a lot of speculation in the media about Aetna,"" said chairman and CEO Mark T. Bertolini. "" As [investor relations vice president] Joe [Krocheski] stated in his introduction, it is our policy not to comment on rumors or speculation.""

The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 26 that CVS has been in talks over the past six months to buy Aetna for more than $200 a share, or about $66 billion.

Aetna and Humana Inc. (HUM) - Get Humana Inc. (HUM) Report in February pulled the plug on their merger agreement after a federal judge in January blocked Aetna's $37 billion bid for Humana at the request of the Department of Justice.

Tuesday's earnings release came after Aetna on Oct. 23 said it has agreed to sell its U.S. group life and disability business to Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG) - Get Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG) Report for $1.45 billion.

23,"Nov 21, 2017",Markets Insider,"RBC: CVS’ Aetna deal is an offensive move against Amazon (CVS, AET)","Thomson Reuters

CVS Health has reportedly been in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for $66 billion.

The move is seen as defense against Amazon's potential entry to the pharmacy space.

RBC Capital Markets said Tuesday the deal is more than just defense and could benefit both companies as well as their shareholders.



Pharmacy giant CVS Health’s proposed $66 billion buyout of health insurer Aetna could be finalized “by the end of November,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

In the roughly three weeks since the merger was first reported, the deal was largely seen as a way for CVS to fend off Amazon’s potential foray into the pharmacy business. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets, however, think the move could have benefits beyond defending against the giant online retailer.

""Investors should view this deal as an offensive move by both companies,” analyst George Hill said in a note Tuesday. ""U.S. healthcare costs approach 20% of GDP, and continue to grow at a rate that exceeds the CPI, serving as a drag on most other industries. Also, with about 90% beneficiary coverage in the U.S., we continue to expect coverage gains to skew towards lower margin government pay books of business while cost pressures drive erosion of commercial benefit coverage.""

""From that perspective, a vertically-integrated, consumer-centric value-based care model makes strong strategic sense and is not a short-sighted response to fears of Amazon entering the pharmacy space,"" Hill said.

The bank maintains its outperform rating for shares of CVS, with a price target of $95 — about 33% higher than the stock’s opening price Tuesday of $70.65. Wall Street's consensus target for CVS is $83, according to Bloomberg data.

Still, there are plenty of unknowns surrounding the deal, with any new clarification coming at an investor event scheduled for December 12.

“The only way this deal can get done is if both management teams are focused on a transaction structure that is value creating for AET and CVS shareholders as opposed to a value exploitative deal to the benefit of AET,"" according to RBC. ""In our opinion, the news today is another data point in support of the willingness of the management teams on both sides to do this deal.""

CVS stock is up roughly 1.08% in trading Tuesday morning and down 11.57% so far this year.

24,"Mar 23, 2018",The Motley Fool,Better Buy: CVS Health Corporation vs. The Kroger Co.,"It isn't easy to find value in today's market. However, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) stand out as two glaring exceptions. Both of these stocks have been hammered over the last year and are trading at a steep discount to the S&P 500.

But which of these retail titans is the better buy today? Let's review the bull case for owning each of them to see if we can identify a winner.

The case for CVS Health

Most investors think that CVS is just a retail pharmacy chain. In truth, that's less than half of the story. CVS also operates the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) business in the country. Let's dissect the growth story for each, starting with CVS.

CVS Health operated more than 9,750 retail pharmacy stores as of the end of 2017. While the company continues to open new stores, it has faced a number of challenges that have caused same-store sales comps to remain weak (most notably reimbursement headwinds and higher sales of generic drugs). On the plus side, the company's in-store MinuteClinics offer investors reason to believe the company can continue to pull in foot traffic and keep online competitors at bay.

Turning to the PBM business, CVS operates as an intermediary between drugmakers and entities that provide healthcare (employers, governments, unions). CVS uses its huge bargaining power to buy drugs in bulk at a discount and then shares the savings with its clients. Given the rampant growth in drug prices over the last few decades, this business has been a strong driver of revenue growth for the company.

As if running a massive retail empire and PBM business wasn't enough, last year, CVS announced its intention to enter the health insurance market, too. The company recently agreed to pay $69 billion to acquire Aetna (NYSE:AET). For perspective, CVS Health's current market cap is $63 billion, so the Aetna deal represents a truly massive bet. If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest acquisition in the company's history.

If everything goes according to plan -- which is a huge if, mind you -- then CVS Health could be poised for turbo-charged growth in the years ahead. Management had previously forecasted double-digit profit growth between its retail and PBM businesses. Adding Aetna to the mix could upsize that number significantly, especially when considering the potential for synergies.

When layering in the gradual graying of the American population, it appears that CVS bulls have reason to believe the wind is at this company's back. Meanwhile, shares offer up a dividend yield of 3.2% and are trading for less than 10 times next year's profit estimates. If the company can deliver on its growth promise, then shares look like a steal today.

The case for Kroger

You might not realize it, but Kroger is actually the second largest grocer in the country. The company has been an acquisition machine over the last few years and now counts brands such as Roundy's, Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, King Soopers, and more in its empire.

While M&A has certainly helped this company grow, Kroger's existing stores have been carrying the weight, too. The company has placed an emphasis on prepared foods and has tacked on pharmacies, gas stations, and more to its stores. These factors have allowed the company to post strong comp gains for more than a decade.

As if that wasn't enough, Kroger is also finally starting to get serious about beefing up its e-commerce capabilities. Using its treasure trove of customer data, the company is starting to roll out its order-and-pickup features in stores. The company's in-store ""Scan, Bag, and Go"" program is also showing traction, and management has announced plans to offer the program in hundreds of stores.

Finally, it's also worth mentioning that the recent tax cuts should be a boon for Kroger's bottom line. The company's historic tax rate is north of 30%. The company estimates that this number will fall to 22% in the year ahead. That might sound like a small difference, but it actually represents hundreds of millions in tax savings that the company can use to reward shareholders.

Kroger managed to grow its EPS by 9% annually over the last five years. When factoring in all of the above, market watchers expect mid-single-digit growth over the next five years. While that's not a blazing-fast number, Kroger's stock is trading for less than 11 times forward earnings and offers up a dividend yield of 2.1%. Those figures could be attractive enough to allow shareholders to come out ahead, even if EPS growth remains modest.

Reasons for caution

Kroger and CVS Health both look cheap, but there are big reasons Wall Street is pricing them at huge discounts.

One big problem facing CVS Health is that it recently lost a substantial amount of business to Walgreen Boots Alliance. That raises concerns that its business isn't as competitive as it should be. Furthermore, rumors that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has taken an interest in the healthcare industry were recently confirmed, which represents a serious long-term threat to the company. Finally, it is notoriously difficult to make large-scale acquisitions like the pending Aetna deal work out. When combined, I understand why Wall Street feels that extreme caution is warranted.

The story looks quite similar at Kroger. Amazon recently entered the grocery market in a major way last year, when it purchased Whole Foods. To combat the threat, Kroger finally decided to start taking its e-commerce business more seriously, but it's possible that it could be too little, too late. What's more, the company is leaning on price cuts as a way to keep its existing customer base loyal. That's pinching margins and is a reason profit growth is expected to be anemic.

The better buy

While I have a hard time calling either of these companies a screaming buy right now, when forced to choose, I'd happily take Kroger. CVS Health's pending Aetna deal wreaks of desperation and will likely be a huge challenge to integrate. Meanwhile, the company isn't ramping up its MinuteClinic network expansion at the pace I had expected, so it's possible the concept is not pulling in new traffic at an acceptable rate.

There's no doubt that Kroger is facing its fair set of challenges, too, but I have simply have much more confidence in its ability to execute its game plan in the years ahead. That's why I think Kroger is the better bet today.","However, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) stand out as two glaring exceptions.

26,"Nov 29, 2017",The Motley Fool,Why 2017 Was a Year to Forget for CVS Health Corporation,"For CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), there was one good thing about 2017: It wasn't as bad as the previous year. But that's faint praise at best. In 2016, the pharmacy giant reeled from two contract wins by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), causing CVS stock to drop 19%. After the dismal performance, CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo called 2017 ""a rebuilding year.""

But investors didn't see any rebuilding of the stock's value. CVS Health's valuation is down more than 10% so far this year. Why was 2017 such a year to forget for CVS Health?

Delayed pain

To understand one key reason behind CVS Health's dismal performance in 2017, we have to look back to last year. In August 2016, Walgreens announced a strategic alliance with Prime Therapeutics. Fourteen Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans own Prime, which ranks as the fourth-largest pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) in the U.S. The next month, Walgreens landed a contract with Tricare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military.

While those deals were made in 2016, CVS Health didn't fully experience the pain from the losses until this year. Tricare began steering its 9.4 million members away from CVS Health and to Walgreens on Dec. 1, 2016. CVS dropped out of the network for Prime Therapeutics' 22 million members on Jan. 1, 2017.

Just as expected, CVS Health's bottom line took a big hit when the company announced its first-quarter results in May. Net income fell nearly 17% year over year, with CVS Health attributing the decline largely to lower volume stemming from the losses to Walgreens.

Major headwinds

But the departures of Prime Therapeutics and Tricare weren't the only problems for CVS Health in 2017. The company faced several headwinds. While its PBM business remained strong, CVS Health's retail/long-term care (LTC) segment didn't fare so well.

The introduction of new generic drugs stood out as one significant issue weighing on retail pharmacy sales. These drugs are less expensive than brand drugs, and therefore cause sales to be lower. At the same time, CVS Health reported higher generic dispensing rates, which increased the impact of the issue. The flip side of the coin, though, is that generic drugs can actually be more profitable for pharmacies than brand drugs.

One challenge that CVS Health went up against that doesn't have a silver lining, however, is continued reimbursement pressure. The company cited this pressure as an issue in all three of its quarterly updates so far in 2017.

Another headwind for the company's retail business this year was wind -- literally. In the third quarter, CVS Health's financial results were negatively impacted by three major hurricanes that hit the southern U.S. and Puerto Rico.

A looming threat

As if all that weren't enough, investors were also rattled by the potential entrance of a formidable new rival in the retail pharmacy industry. In May, reports began to surface that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was evaluating the possibility of selling prescription drugs online. The news caused the stock prices of the big pharmacy chains to drop almost immediately.

Could Amazon take a significant chunk of market share away from CVS Health? Some might scoff at the idea, but I wouldn't be surprised if the internet retailer was successful if it decides to jump into the pharmacy world. In my view, dismissing the potential threat from Amazon would be a huge mistake.

Apparently, CVS Health's executives agree at least to some extent that Amazon is a threat. CVS revealed a new home-delivery program in early November that analysts quickly began referring to as the company's ""Amazon strategy."" The company will offer next-day delivery from all of its stores starting in 2018. CVS Health will also provide free same-day delivery for prescription drugs and some front-store products in certain markets.

Looking ahead

Will 2018 be a better year than 2017 for CVS Health? Possibly. The company had a strong PBM selling season for 2018. Personalization and promotional strategies have improved front-store profitability. CVS is enjoying solid growth from its store brands. The possibility of corporate tax reform in the U.S. could also be a big deal for the company, with its high effective tax rate.

Then there's the matter of a potential acquisition of Aetna (NYSE:AET). The Wall Street Journal reported in October that CVS Health had made a $66 billion bid for Aetna, the third-largest health insurer in the U.S. CVS Health's executives didn't say anything about this possible deal in the third-quarter conference call. However, the company's CFO, David Denton, stated that ""M&A [mergers and acquisitions] has always been at the core of our business, and we will continue to do that as we think -- as we look forward.""

If an Aetna deal does happen, 2018 won't be a year to forget for CVS Health. Instead, it will be a memorable year that radically transforms the company over the long run.","For CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), there was one good thing about 2017: It wasn't as bad as the previous year.

27,"Apr 22, 2018",The Motley Fool,Better Buy: CVS Health Corporation vs. Express Scripts,"The U.S. healthcare industry is in the middle of an upheaval. Lines between health insurers, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) are becoming increasingly blurred. There are probably no better examples of this than CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).

CVS Health ranks as the largest pharmacy chain and the second-largest PBM in the U.S. In December, the company announced plans to merge with Aetna (NYSE:AET), the No. 3 health insurer in the country. Express Scripts is the biggest PBM. In March, Cigna (NYSE:CI), the fifth-largest health insurer in the U.S., announced that it was acquiring Express Scripts.

Which stock is the better choice for investors now between CVS Health and Express Scripts? It's complicated.

The case for CVS Health

Many investors are skeptical about CVS Health's planned acquisition of Aetna. The deal means that CVS Health will accumulate a lot of additional debt. The company's steady dividend increases of the past few years ground to a halt. There's no guarantee that integration of the two organizations will go smoothly.

However, one of the most significant challenges with the U.S. healthcare system is that it's so fragmented. A combination of a large pharmacy chain, PBM, and health insurer -- in addition to CVS Health's MinuteClinic walk-in clinics that are in many of its pharmacy stores -- could be just what's needed.

CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo thinks the merger with Aetna will enable the resulting entity ""to remake the consumer healthcare experience."" It's quite possible that CVS Health will be able to introduce innovative new products that manage chronic care more effectively once the deal is finalized. That could lead to nice revenue and earnings growth over the long run.

But will the deal actually go through? That remains to be seen. The U.S. Department of Justice is closely scrutinizing the proposed merger of the two companies.

One key reason for investors to consider buying CVS Health is that the stock trades for less than 10 times expected earnings. A combination with Aetna would increase the resulting entity's valuation somewhat, though, since Aetna's share price is currently 14.5 times expected earnings.

And while CVS Health's dividend hikes of the past are at least temporarily on hold, investors should still like the yield of more than 3%. The company should be able to sustain payment of its dividend at current levels even with the assumption of additional debt to fund the Aetna acquisition.

The case for Express Scripts

Why think about buying Express Scripts? For one thing, the stock should move higher if Cigna is allowed to buy the big PBM.

Cigna offered a cash and stock transaction valued at roughly $54 billion plus assumption of Express Scripts' debt of around $15 billion. Express Scripts' current market cap stands around $41 billion. If the deal goes through, investors buying Express Scripts now would see a return of over 30% by the end of 2018.

It's important to note, though, that the market appears to think the acquisition could be blocked by regulators. While Express Scripts jumped immediately following the announcement of a potential buyout by Cigna, shares fell soon afterward. Express Scripts stock price is now close to its level prior to when news broke about the acquisition. Cigna however, said in a statement this week that it is ""optimistic in our ability to obtain regulatory approval.""

Still, investors need to consider the case for Express Scripts if the Cigna deal doesn't happen. The good news for Express Scripts is that it remains the No. 1 PBM in the U.S. at a time when controlling prescription drug costs is as important as ever. As baby boomers age, they are likely to require more prescription drugs, a trend that should benefit Express Scripts.

However, there's also bad news for Express Scripts. The company's revenue declined a little in 2017 compared to the prior year. Earnings were higher year over year, but the increase was primarily due to a larger tax hit in 2016.

The worst news for Express Scripts is that its contract with Anthem expires at the end of 2019 -- and Anthem doesn't intend to renew the agreement. The insurer is Express Scripts' largest customer, contributing 19% of the PBM's total revenue last year. Changing dynamics in the healthcare landscape could make it difficult for Express Scripts to make up for the loss of the Anthem revenue.

Express Scripts stock is cheap right now, with shares trading at a little more than seven times expected earnings. However, that low valuation reflects the challenges that the PBM faces over the next few years.

Better buy

If neither of these two companies' deals actually happen, I think CVS Health is better positioned for the long run. However, if Cigna's acquisition of Express Scripts wins approval by regulators, Express Scripts will enjoy a much bigger boost in its stock price than CVS Health will. On the other hand, if CVS Health's merger with Aetna closes but Cigna doesn't buy Express Scripts, my winner between the two is again CVS Health. Clear as mud, right?

My guess -- and it's only a guess -- is that both deals will secure approval. They're both different scenarios than a combination of two companies in the exact same line of business. If I'm right, Express Scripts is the better stock to buy right now, even though I think CVS Health has the better long-term prospects.

However, I'm not certain the Cigna buyout of Express Scripts will actually go through. As a result, I'm not calling Express Scripts as a stock to buy right now. Like I said earlier, it's complicated.","There are probably no better examples of this than CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).

CVS and Amazon are emerging to be two of the biggest rivals in business in America today. This week alone has been punch and counter-punch between the two companies vying for some of the richest business opportunities -- retail, healthcare, and pharmacy.

Top analysts warn that Amazon is coming after CVS's core business.

The genesis of CVS and Amazon could not be more different. Consumer Value Store started in 1963 as a health and beauty retailer in Lowell. Today it is the largest pharmacy chain in America with 9,600 plus stores.

Amazon was first founded as Cadabra, by Jeff Bezos in 1994 as an online bookstore — quickly the company was renamed and today it is the world's largest online retailer by revenue.

Now, one business consultant is warning that Amazon's recent moves threaten CVS and its peers.

""The most loyal part of their [CVS and Walgreens] pharmacy customer base is the older consumer. Over the next ten years, this cohort will become a much less significant part of the market and this will leave drugstores exposed to younger shoppers who are more likely to use both Amazon and remote pharmacy services. There is a significant risk that drugstores will see a real erosion in pharmacy customer share, especially in urban and suburban areas where Amazon can quickly deliver,"" writes Neil Saunders, Managing Director of Global Data retail in the trade magazine Chain Store Age in June.

On Wednesday, CVS Pharmacy, the retail division of CVS Health announced that Boston-area customers can enroll in CarePass, a new pilot membership rewards program offering additional benefits to the company's popular ExtraCare Rewards Program -- think the CVS version of Amazon Prime.

CarePass offers members a “suite of in-store and online perks including free delivery on most medications and purchases, access to a 24/7 pharmacist hotline and 20% off all CVS Health brand products.”

According to CVS, customers can join CarePass for $5 a month or $48 a year and also receive a monthly $10 CarePass promotional reward that can be used towards nearly all purchases in-store and online at CVS.com.

""We are committed to designing and testing innovative programs that meet our customers' health needs whenever, wherever and however they want,"" says Kevin Hourican, Executive Vice President, CVS Health and President, CVS Pharmacy. ""The CarePass pilot program in Boston offers our customers an additional level of benefits and services that make it easy to save time, save money and receive access to on-demand pharmacy care.""

But, CVS starts this week with zero customers for their new service and Amazon Prime has more than 100 million members globally — each paying $119 annually (students pay $59 a year).

Also this week, Amazon Prime members in the Stamford, CT area now can receive same-day and maybe nearly same hour delivery of groceries from Whole Foods Market starting.

Through the service, Prime members are able to receive delivery of thousands of Whole Foods Market items in less than an hour to customer’s front doors. The service rolled out first in June in Boston with two-hour service.

Also, in June, Amazon purchased PillPack and Saunders says it is a big danger sign for CVS and its pharmacy rival Walgreens.

“Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space. Not only has Amazon finally made a solid move into pharmacy, it has done so via an innovative supplier which helps patients manage and organize their prescription drugs,” wrote Saunders.

“In our view, this is only the first play in what will be an increasingly aggressive strategy by Amazon to develop a much more significant presence in the pharmacy market. This is incredibly bad news for traditional players, like Walgreens and CVS, who stand to lose the most from Amazon’s determination to grow its share,” added Saunders.

CVS’ Aetna Merger and Amazon’s Whole Foods Markets Purchase

All of this comes after more than a year of mega deal-making by both CVS and Amazon. Amazon purchased in Whole Foods Market in the spring of 2017. And, in December 2017, CVS finalized the deal points for its acquisition of Aetna.

At the time, a GoLocal analysis found that a combined CVS and Aetna company will be the second largest revenue company in the United States — at $240 billion — ahead of Apple ($215B) and Berkshire Hathaway ($223B). The only company in America doing more revenue would be Walmart ($485B).

The biggest winner in the proposed acquisition of Aetna by CVS may be Rhode Island. The deal is one of the biggest business deals in the United States will transform the company and its role in healthcare in America.

“It positions CVS Health as a disrupter instead of the disrupted. It's obvious from our national healthcare policy debate -- and the growing number of families that can't access or afford the healthcare -- that we need transformational new healthcare business models. Tweaking today's healthcare models isn't working,” Saul Kaplan, Founder and Chief Catalyst at Business Innovation Factory told GoLocal in November of 2017.

CVS said it expects to realize $750 million in ""synergies"" through a number of cuts including reducing corporate redundancies between the two companies. They expect those savings to be realized within the first two years.

In October, the Justice Department gave conditional approval of the CVS-Aetna deal. The companies must first shed their Medicare Part D business before final approval. That is expected by the end of 2018.

Where the CVS and Amazon rivalry goes next is anyone's guess, but make no mistake about it, this is emerging to biggest rivalry in American business today.

29,"Nov 6, 2017",Reuters,Drug distributor McKesson to buy CVS Health's services unit,"(Reuters) - Drug distributor McKesson Corp MCK.N said on Monday it would buy drugstore operator CVS Health Corp's CVS.N unit that provides various tailored services to pharma firms in a $735 million deal to expand the range of services it offers.

The unit, RxCrossroads, provides reimbursement support, integration with network pharmacies, patient adherence programs, specialty logistics services, sales operations support and mail-order pharmacy services.

McKesson said the deal will also add plasma logistics to its manufacturer services, which will allow it “to serve biopharma companies of all sizes and throughout the product life cycle.”

The deal comes as growing speculation that Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is planning to enter the prescription drug business has sent tremors through the pharmaceutical supply chain and rattled the shares of the drug distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and drug retailers.

Many companies in the industry are preparing for the online retailer’s entry, with the latest comments coming from CVS Health itself earlier in the day after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.

CVS Health said it would start next-day delivery from its stores in 2018, a move analysts said was to fortify itself against Amazon’s possible entry.

CVS Health, which acquired RxCrossroads from Omnicare Inc in 2015, is also reported to be in talks to buy health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.

McKesson said the deal to buy RxCrossroads was valued at about $635 million, net of the present value of incremental cash tax benefits. The deal will be funded by cash on hand.

McKesson said the deal will add about 20 cents to its adjusted earnings per share by the third year after the deal closes, which is expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

30,"Mar 31, 2018",Reuters,"Come for your drugs, leave with more shopping: Walmart's new growth strategy?","(Reuters) - Walmart Inc’s WMT.N efforts to develop closer ties with health insurer Humana Inc HUM.N, which came to light on Thursday, point to a brave new world of retail where superstores become healthcare centers offering basic medical care.

They are also aimed at boosting Walmart's slowing growth in brick-and-mortar store sales as it faces increasing pressure online from Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. Deepening its existing partnership with Humana, or even acquiring the company outright, could be a step toward turning its 4,700 or so U.S. stores into healthcare centers that aim to attract more shoppers over 65.

“The end goal here is to get more people in their stores, get them to buy drugs and make an additional purchase while they are in the store,” said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.

If Walmart can offer “competitive rates” on primary care and other health services, he said, it “can grow traffic and push store visits.”

Walmart approached Humana this month, and the companies began to discuss closer ties focused on new partnerships, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. An acquisition of Humana by Walmart is also being discussed, the sources said.

Walmart declined comment Friday. Humana could not immediately be reached for comment.

Closer ties between the two could enable the retailer to tap into Humana’s patient roster and possibly put some of its physician clinics in stores to offer medical care to customers.

Walmart is the largest retailer to hit upon the combination of retail and health insurance, but it is not the first.

CVS Health Corp CVS.N has struck a $69 billion deal to acquire Aetna Inc AET.N. Separately, insurer Cigna Corp CI.N has a $54 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits company Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O. The two deals, if approved, will put pressure on the entire health care supply chain.

AMAZON CHECKMATE?

Humana could provide Walmart with “one more way to checkmate Amazon and equal and eclipse the CVS/Target partnership and equal and eclipse the CVS/Aetna partnership,” said Burt Flickinger at marketing consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.

“It allows them to get ahead of everybody from warehouse club operators like Costco, Target and other retailers who run chain drugstores as well as food and drug combo operators like Kroger and Wegmans.”

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart already has pharmacies at many store locations and has a co-branded drug plan with Humana that caters to patients using Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over 65. That plan steers patients to Walmart stores for their pharmacy needs, offering customers an opportunity to save up to 20 percent on drug costs, analysts said.

Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana is one of the country’s largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans - a type of coverage offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare.

Humana has 5.1 million seniors on prescription drug benefits and another 3.5 million on full medical benefits, according to Ana Gupte, senior health care analyst with Leerink Partners in New York.

Walmart superstores “could be a one-stop shop for seniors,” said Gupte, adding that Humana already has about 50 pharmacies sharing locations with doctors’ clinics, and could expand that model using Walmart’s real estate and pharmacies.

DATA ANALYSIS

There is also a potential for Walmart and Humana to benefit from their mass of customer data, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

“One thing retailers have is a very good understanding of customers. They know their eating habits and other consumption patterns and that is quite useful in forming insurance decisions,” he said. “That is certainly something that Walmart would be able to leverage.”

Humana patients are most likely already heavy shoppers at Walmart, according to David Friend at the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence and Innovation.

“If you know that somebody is on a certain medicine you can sell them other products and services and that will help keep customer loyalty,” he said.","FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walmart is seen on shopping trolleys at their store in Sao Paulo, Brazil February 14, 2018.

Citing anonymous sources from Washington, D.C., the New York Post reported that the DOJ will likely be the agency to review the deal since the FTC is missing three out of its five customary commissioners.

The DOJ also has the benefit of the expertise it gained from reviewing the Aetna-Humana deal, the article noted. Regulators sued to block that deal—and Anthem’s bid to acquire Cigna—and won both cases in federal court.

That is perhaps why one source told the Post that the two companies would have preferred the FTC to review their deal. The FTC typically reviews mergers of retail businesses like CVS, while the DOJ usually handles health insurer mergers, noted a Bloomberg article.

Meanwhile, the CVS-Aetna deal has already raised the hackles of some Democratic lawmakers. New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone Jr., the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has requested a hearing on the proposed acquisition.

“As the business of healthcare continues to morph, it is critical that Congress closely examine the changing relationships among healthcare entities and the impact these changing relationships have on the way healthcare is delivered in this country,” Pallone wrote in a letter to Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore.

“Due to the scale of the CVS Health-Aetna merger, these changes should be thoroughly scrutinized and understood by the members of this committee,” he added.

CVS is awaiting federal approval for its acquisition of Aetna — a $69 billion deal, but a story broken by CNN adds a twist.

CNN reports that “California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.”

The massive deal needs approval from both the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

“California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna.’If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records, that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law,’ said Jones,” according to CNN.

34,"Apr 15, 2018",The Columbus Dispatch,"Three CVS actions raise concerns for some pharmacies, consumers","First, CVS set up a website for consumers to compare drug prices.

But the site gave clear preference to CVS pharmacies, automatically putting them at the top of the comparison list. That occurred despite a ""firewall"" that's legally required between the drugstore chain and CVS Caremark, the drug giant's pharmacy benefit manager that runs the site.

Second, CVS's benefit manager cut Medicaid reimbursements to local Ohio pharmacies this past fall, which some say put them in financial jeopardy. Then CVS's ""acquisition unit"" sent letters to many of those same pharmacies, saying times are tough and asking whether they would be interested in selling their business.

And in a third action that is raising concerns among independent pharmacists and consumers, CVS dialed up Roberta Timmons.

When the 67-year-old Honda retiree received a telephone message a few weeks ago about her prescription drugs, she assumed it was from her longtime neighborhood pharmacist.

But when Timmons returned the call, the Plain City resident was told that she could save money by transferring her prescriptions to a CVS pharmacy. The caller was CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for SilverScript, a CVS-affiliated supplemental drug plan serving seniors covered by Medicare.

""I thought: 'Why are they calling me when I don’t have prescriptions filled at CVS?'"" Timmons asked. ""What prescriptions was I missing or not getting filled?""

After learning that SilverScript and CVS Caremark were both part of CVS, Timmons, who has gone to the same independent Plain City pharmacy for 20 years, went from confused to angry.

""Knowing that I’ve been with one certain pharmacy for so many years — and then they think they can call and get me to change over certain prescriptions or tell me that I’m not getting the prescriptions I’m supposed to have?""

'Extremely concerning'

The interaction between CVS and Timmons — as well as the buyout offers and the website — are part of a pattern, CVS critics say, of reaching around the firewall to help the company's bottom line and drive out competition. In roughly the past three years, the number of independent pharmacies in Ohio has declined by 164, and the number of CVS pharmacies (which took over the pharmacies in Target stores) has climbed by 68, Ohio Board of Pharmacy data show.

Federal regulators required the firewall when CVS and Caremark merged in 2007, to make sure those in one part of the business did not use confidential information and economic power to unfairly help the other.

In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission closed an investigation into allegations of such anti-competitive practices as patient steering and spread pricing (profiteering), saying that it would ""not take any additional action at this time"" against CVS, now the nation's seventh-largest company.

Mike DeAngelis, CVS's senior director for corporate communication, said in an email: ""CVS Health maintains stringent firewall protections between our CVS Pharmacy retail business and our CVS Caremark PBM business, and takes these protections very seriously.""

During the call to Timmons, a CVS Caremark representative said she was contacted to inform her that two of her medications could be refilled in a 90-day supply. When Timmons asked about her other prescriptions, the representative provided the cost at her pharmacy — which the caller could learn because CVS's PBM provided the payment — compared with the cost at a CVS store. The CVS price was always cheaper. No pricing information was given for other pharmacies such as Kroger or Walgreens.

CVS up, independents downInfogram

In a letter to another central Ohio Medicare recipient, SilverScript made a more open pitch for CVS.

""Our records indicate that you recently filled your prescriptions at a standard pharmacy,"" the form letter read. ""To begin saving, transfer your prescriptions to any preferred pharmacy.

""You can choose from more than 26,000 preferred pharmacies, including all CVS Pharmacy locations, CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy and thousands of regional and local independent pharmacies.""

For ""convenience,"" SilverScript provided the names, addresses and telephone numbers of three nearby pharmacies: two CVS locations and Decillion Healthcare of Dublin — which is not a retail drugstore but a provider of infusion therapy for patients with chronic conditions such as cancer.

""You couldn't find a pill in the place,"" said Antonio Ciaccia of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, who has visited Decillion.

He called CVS's unsolicited calls and letters ""extremely concerning,"" adding, ""it confirms every conspiracy theory that pharmacists have been holding onto since this merger took place years ago.""

""I've always had concerns that there's no such thing as a firewall,"" said state Rep. Scott Lipps, R-Franklin, who has written several bills meant to bring greater transparency to PBMs for Ohio Medicaid. ""You can tell me there is, but you can't prove to me there is.""

DeAngelis said, ""CVS Caremark makes outbound phone calls on behalf of its PBM clients, including SilverScript, to educate members about medication adherence, ensuring the member is filling and taking their prescription medication appropriately to maximize clinical outcomes. It is not our policy or practice to knowingly provide inaccurate information to a member, and we will be following up with Ms. Simmons to clarify any confusion and address any concerns.""

Buyout offers

Last fall, some smaller Ohio pharmacies saw the amounts they were being paid for prescriptions to Medicaid recipients drop considerably. CVS Caremark is the pharmacy benefit manager for four of the five managed-care organizations hired by the state to handle drug benefits for the poor and disabled on the federal-state health-care program, and thus controls the price that pharmacies are paid.

A short time later, independent pharmacists started receiving letters from CVS Pharmacy.

""I'm a pharmacist myself,"" said the one-page letter from Shane Stockton, regional director of acquisitions. ""I know what independents are experiencing right now: declining reimbursements, increasing costs, a more complex regulatory environment. Mounting challenges like these make selling your store to CVS Pharmacy an attractive and practical option.""

Some pharmacists said it's interesting timing that the buyout letters from CVS Pharmacy came shortly after reimbursements from CVS Caremark dropped.

""The senior management of Caremark has something going with the senior management of CVS Pharmacy,"" said Nnodum Iheme, owner of Ziks Family Pharmacy and Home Medical Equipment. ""They're trying to drive everyone out of business.""

Iheme, whose store serves Dayton's historic Wright-Dunbar Village, said he received a similar letter from CVS this past summer, after another reimbursement cut.

""We have a lot of Caremark patients, so this really hits us bad,"" he said. Only his medical-device and home-health businesses allow him to survive financially, Iheme said.

Stockton didn't return a call requesting comment.

Arkansas pharmacists reported something similar at the start of this year, which prompted that state's attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, to launch an investigation.

“The change in reimbursement rates by pharmacy benefit managers has hurt Arkansas in every community across the state,” Rutledge said. “Due to these changes, pharmacists are facing tough decisions because reimbursements do not cover the actual cost of the medications.”

CVS's DeAngelis said, ""Our retail business has engaged in acquisition activity and outreach to other pharmacies since well before CVS and Caremark merged and, in fact, the communications materials related to this activity has been relatively unchanged over the years. Any retail acquisition activity is completely unrelated to, separated from, and not coordinated in any way with the PBM business’ management of its pharmacy network.""

State Medicaid officials were aware of the juxtaposition between the cuts to pharmacies and the buyout offers, said Patrick Stephan, the agency's director of managed care.

During a mid-December conference call with CVS officials, Stephan said, Medicaid leaders ""made it abundantly clear"" they were worried about poor Ohioans' access to needed medications because the financial blow to pharmacies could drive some out of business. A special concern was the drop in reimbursement for suboxone, a treatment for addiction widely used in Ohio's opioid crisis.

""We effectively made it clear that, one way or another, these problems were going to have to be resolved,” Stephan said.

It worked: The totals paid to local pharmacies were increased early this year.

But the Medicaid agency couldn't do anything about the offer of buyouts, which CVS officials told them was a coincidence in timing.

""We don’t have any reason to believe that was not the case, but I can certainly understand pharmacies' concerns about both happening at same time,"" said Medicaid spokeswoman Melissa Ayers. ""That’s really an optic that they have to deal with — that CVS has to deal with.""

For Lipps, the Ohio lawmaker, the buyout offers raise suspicion.

""Receiving a letter saying that 'we know you're struggling financially and we'll acquire you now' — there's too much information and that makes me think that there was no firewall,"" he said.

CVS gets default setting

The CVS Caremark website offering price comparisons doesn't tell users that CVS Pharmacy's mail-order service will be listed first and a CVS retail store will be listed second — every time.

DeAngelis said crossing the firewall here is allowed: ""It does not limit all information-sharing between the businesses, and applies only to certain information that may give our pharmacy provider businesses or our PBM an unfair advantage over their competitors.""

Several Ohio pharmacists are suspicious because the website comparison virtually always shows an independent with the lowest price and a CVS pharmacy with the highest. Though that might seem like good news for the independent druggists at first glance, they worry the low prices translate into lower reimbursements that are supposed to cover the pharmacy's cost of obtaining the drug in the first place.

And because prices and reimbursement rates are both set by CVS's pharmacy benefits manager, they say the higher consumer prices at CVS pharmacies could mean higher reimbursements for the same drugs — and more profit for CVS over the drug's actual cost.



""Pharmacists have always been spooked that a PBM affiliated with a pharmacy could exploit the business model and warp incentives to steer traffic in their direction, pay themselves more than their competitors and ultimately drive those competitor pharmacies out of business,"" said Ciaccia, of the Ohio Pharmacists Association.

Not so, said DeAngelis: ""That does not reflect the PBM’s reimbursement to the pharmacy. The fact is, overall, CVS Caremark reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than larger chains, including CVS Pharmacy.""

CVS Health Corp. (CVS) - Get CVS Health Corporation Report has agreed to sell RxCrossroads, a service provider to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers, to McKesson Corp. (MCK) - Get McKesson Corporation (MCK) Report in a deal valued at $735 million, the acquirer said after the market close on Monday, Nov. 6.

The deal value net of the present value of incremental cash tax benefits is about $635 million, McKesson said.

San Francisco-based McKesson said the purchase will enhance its commercialization offerings for makers of branded, specialty, generic and biosimilar drugs. The deal will also add plasma logistics to its manufacturer services.

""We view [the deal] as a smart strategic move to help position the company for the continued importance and growth of specialty pharma products,"" wrote Leerink Partners David Larsen in a note Monday.

The transaction is expected to close in McKesson's fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which ends on March 31. RxCrossroads will be part of McKesson's specialty health unit.

""RxCrossroads provides tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers and will enhance MCK's existing solutions for manufacturers,"" added Larsen.

McKesson plans to fund the purchase with cash on hand. The company said it expects the acquisition to be about 20 cents accretive to adjusted earnings per diluted share by the third year following the deal's close.

Omnicare Inc. acquired RxCrossroads for $235 million in 2005. Omincare, in turn, was purchased by CVS in 2015 for a total enterprise value of about $12.9 billion.

Shares of CVS closed at $66.80 on Monday, down 3.5%. McKesson shares closed at $135.21, down 1.7%.

CVS also unveiled on Monday third-quarter results and raised its full-year guidance range. The Woonsocket, R.I.-based posted earnings per share of $1.50 and $46.2 billion in revenue. That's compared to analysts' estimates of $1.48 per share and revenue of $46.17 billion, according to Factset Research Systems.

Same-store sales in pharmacy dipped 3.4%, while front-store same-store sales also declined by 2.8%.

For full-year 2017, CVS said it now expects earnings to be between $5.87 and $5.91 per share, up from between $5.83 and $5.93. Cash flow is now projected to a total of $8.6 billion, up from $7.7.

The earnings release and the RxCrossroads divestiture came on the heels of a Reuters report on Nov. 3 that a deal between CVS and Aetna Inc. (AET) could come as soon as next month. The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 26 that CVS has been in talks over the past six months to buy Aetna for more than $200 a share.

After Amazon (AMZN) acquired online pharmacy PillPack in January 2018, solidifying its entrance into the pharmacy market, CVS went on the offense. The pharmacy and drugstore chain purchased health insurance company Aetna Inc. (AET) in a $69 billion deal that was approved by shareholders in March 2018.

CVS Health Corp reported Q3 2018 earnings on November 6, 2018. The pharmacy and drugstore chain reported $47.3 billion in revenues this quarter, beating Wall Street estimates of $47.2 billion and last-year revenues of $46.2 billion.

Here are the four largest individual shareholders of CVS.

Larry J. Merlo

Larry J. Merlo is the director, president, and chief executive officer of CVS Health Corp. Merlo joined CVS as an on-site assistant manager in 1990 after the company acquired People's Drug, a chain of drugstores in Alexandra, West Virginia. Just over twenty years later, Merlo had worked his way up to the position of CEO at the largest pharmacy and drugstore chain in the world. Under Merlo's guidance, CVS has aggressively built out its health section, making massive acquisitions like their $2.1 billion purchase of Coram, an enteral nutrition company, and their $12.7 billion purchase of Omnicare, which supplies prescription drugs to nursing homes.

Per Merlo's latest filing with the SEC on April 1, 2018, the CVS CEO owns 330,107 shares of the company directly and another 370,165 held indirectly through a trust. With a combined 700,000 shares, Merlo weighs in as the company's single-largest individual shareholder.

C. David Brown II

C. David Brown II sits on the board of directors of CVS and is the company's second-largest individual shareholder. Mr. Brown previously served on the board of Caremark Rx, Inc. from March 2001 until March 2007, when Caremark and CVS Health closed a merger deal. Brown also serves as a director of Rayonier Advanced Materials and previously served as a chair of Broad and Cassel, a Florida-based law firm.

According to a May 4, 2018 filing with the SEC, Brown holds 101,252 shares of CVS.

Troyen A. Brennan

Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Troyen A. Brennan, M.D. is the Chief Medical Officer at Aetna Inc. CVS Health CEO Larry J. Merlo expects to close the $69 billion Aetna Inc. acquisition later this year and named Brennan as the company's executive vice president and chief medical officer.

Brennan owns 84,723 shares of CVS stock as of an April 1, 2018 SEC filing, making him the company's third-largest shareholder.

Helena Foulkes

Helena Foulkes is the former president of CVS's pharmacy division, serving in the position from 2014 until her departure from the company in February 2018. Foulkes held several other roles at CVS since joining the company in 1992, including executive vice president and chief marketing officer at CVS Caremark. In February 2018, Foulkes was named chief executive officer of Hudon's Bay Company, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor.

Although Foulkes' stock ownership is subject to change after leaving the company, she holds 45,107 shares of CVS as of February 16, 2018.","Consumer Value Stores, better known as CVS Health Corp (CVS), is the largest pharmacy and drugstore chain in the United States.

While consolidation is a common trend across many sectors—including anatomic pathology groups and hospital systems—UnitedHealth Group is the latest example of the payer-provider consolidation trend impacting medical laboratories nationwide

Pending the successful completion of a $4.9-billion acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) will be poised to become the largest single employer of doctors in the U.S., according to numbers reported by leading sources.

Clinical laboratories, anatomic pathology groups, and other service providers that service those doctors should already be taking a serious look at their revenue flows and efficiencies to maintain margins and weather the shift into a model of value-based reimbursement.

Controlling Costs with Direct Care

According to a press release, UnitedHealth Group’s (NYSE:UNH) direct-to-patient healthcare subsidiary, OptumCare, currently employs or is affiliated with 30,000 physicians. And, DaVita Medical Group, a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (NYSA:DVA), lists 13,000 affiliated physicians on their website. Should acquisition of DaVita Medical Group go forward, OptumCare would have approximately 43,000 affiliated or employed physicians—roughly 5,000 more physicians than HCA Healthcare and nearly double Kaiser Permanente’s 22,080 physicians—thus, making OptumCare’s parent company UNH the largest individual employer of physicians in the U.S. The acquisition is reportedly to reinforce UNH’s ability to control costs and manage the care experience by acquiring office-based physicians to provide services.

OptumCare has seen significant growth over the past decade. OptumHealth, one of three segments of UNH’s overall Optum healthcare subsidiary, includes OptumCare medical groups and IPAs, MedExpress urgent care, Surgical Care Affiliates ambulatory surgery centers, HouseCalls home visits, behavioral health, care management, and Rally Health wellness and digital consumer engagement.

Acquisitions of Doctors on the Rise; Clinical Lab Revenues Threatened

Independent physicians and practices have been a hot commodity in recent years. A March 2018 study from Avalere Health in collaboration with the Physicians Advocacy Institute (PAI) showed that the number of physicians employed by hospitals rose from 26% in July 2012 to 42% in 2016—a rise of 16% over four years.

By acquiring physicians of their own, insurance companies like UnitedHealth Group believe they can offset the cost and shifts in service of these prior trends. “We’re in an arms race with hospital systems,” John Gorman of Gorman Health Group told Bloomberg. “The goal is to better control the means of production in their key markets.”

According to Modern Healthcare, the acquisition of DaVita Medical Group is UnitedHealth’s third such acquisition in 2017. Other acquisitions include:

Surgical Care Affiliates for $1.3-billion in January; and,

Advisory Board, a healthcare consulting firm, for $2.3-billion in November.

Along with Surgical Care Affiliates came a chain of surgery centers that, according to The New York Times (NYT), OptumCare plans to use to perform approximately one million surgeries and other outpatient procedures this year alone, while reducing expenses for outpatient surgeries by more than 50%.

NYT also noted that acquisition of DaVita Medical Group doesn’t bring just physicians under the OptumCare umbrella, but also nearly 250 MedExpress urgent care locations across the country.

By having physicians, clinical laboratories, outpatient surgery centers, and urgent care centers within their own networks, insurance providers then can steer patients toward the lowest-cost options within their networks and away from more expensive hospitals. This could mean less demand on independent clinical laboratories and hospitals and, with that, reduced cash flows.

According to NYT, Optum currently works with more than 80 health plans. However, mergers such these—including those between CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Aetna (NYSE:AET), and the proposed agreement between Humana (NYSE:HUM) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to deliver healthcare in the retailers’ stores—indicate that insurers are seeking ways to offer care in locations consumers find most accessible, while also working to exert influence on who patients seek out, to generate cost advantages for the insurers.

This consolidation should concern hospitals as payers increasingly draw physicians from them, potentially also taking away their patients. The impact, however, may also reach independent medical laboratories, medical imaging centers, anatomic pathology groups, and other healthcare service providers that provide diagnoses and treatments in today’s complex healthcare system.

Deep Payer Pockets Mean Fewer Patients for Clinical Labs and Medical Groups

As this trend continues, it could gain momentum and potentially funnel more patients toward similar setups. Major corporations have deeper pockets to advertise their physicians, medical laboratories, and other service providers—or to raise public awareness and improve reputations. Such support might be harder to justify for independent healthcare providers and medical facilities with shrinking budgets and margins in the face of healthcare reform.

Shawn Purifoy, MD, a family medicine practitioner in Malvern, Ark., expressed his concern succinctly in The New York Times. “I can’t advertise on NBC [but] CVS can,” he noted.

While further consolidation within independent clinical laboratories and hospitals might help to fend off this latest trend, it remains essential that medical laboratories and other service providers continue to optimize efficiency and educate both physicians and payers on the value of their services—particularly those services offered at higher margins or common to menus across a range of service providers.

42,"Nov 21, 2017",Reuters,Prospect of tougher antitrust regulation worries deal investors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. antitrust regulator has sent a chilling message to dealmakers with his opposition to AT&T Inc T.N buying Time Warner Inc TWX.N: Companies do not have to be competitors for their merger to hurt competition, and there are no simple fixes to get such deals approved.

FILE PHOTO - An AT&T logo is seen at a AT&T building in New York City, October 23, 2016. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo

The Department of Justice's lawsuit to block the AT&T purchase could be a negative sign for other so-called ""vertical"" mergers - where the companies do not compete but one supplies the other - such as pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp's CVS.N plan to buy insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.

Investors had thought AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, if not a slam dunk, would be approved by the Justice Department and its antitrust division chief Makan Delrahim with relatively few asset sales or conditions.

Delrahim dashed those hopes on Monday when the Justice Department sued AT&T, arguing that the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier would use Time Warner’s content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.”

With the case headed to court, traders are upping their bets that similar mergers awaiting approval will not be endorsed by regulators even though it has been decades since the Justice Department last successfully sued to stop a vertical merger.

Shares of Time Warner have fallen 10 percent since word first leaked in early November that the Justice Department might challenge the AT&T purchase.

Market confidence in the deal closing went from around 80 percent to around 30 percent, according to Samir Kapadia of VogelHood Group, which uses public data to predict future U.S. government actions for investors, industry groups and others.

“Investors were shocked and the market responded,” said Kapadia. “Everyone on Wall Street feels like they’re missing something here.”

Traders who watch mergers and acquisitions closely had concerns about other deals that had not yet closed, in addition to the proposed CVS acquisition of Aetna.

“People see the DoJ (the Justice Department) under Trump as less predictable (than) they thought,” said a trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect business relationships.

CLASSIC VERTICAL

CVS made an offer to acquire No. 3 U.S. health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, people familiar with the matter said in late October.

German drugmaker Bayer's BAYGn.DE plan to buy Monsanto Co MON.N for $63.5 billion including debt could also be affected by the Justice Department's revived interest in vertical transactions.

The focus of the merger review so far has been on the few areas of overlap - like canola seeds - but the main thrust of the merger is to combine Monsanto’s seed business with Bayer’s expertise in crop protection, a classic vertical transaction.

Germany's Fresenius Medical Care's FMEG.DE $2 billion deal to acquire a supplier, U.S. dialysis equipment maker NxStage Medical Inc NXTM.O, has also started to struggle in the market.

Since doubts about the AT&T-Time Warner deal began to build, NxStage shares have weakened from the price offered by Fresenius Medical. Previously they traded at about a 10.5 percent discount to the $30 a share takeover price; that discount has mushroomed to nearly 14 percent.

To be sure, the negative antitrust response to AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner may not be a clear indicator of a broader shift in approach. The deal has been unusually politically charged since Donald Trump attacked the deal on the campaign trail last year. As president, he raised his opposition again on Tuesday, saying it was “not a good deal for the country.”

CLOSELY MONITORED

In antitrust circles, the court fight between the government and AT&T will be closely monitored since the Justice Department has not successfully litigated against a vertical deal since the 1970s.

That said, the Justice Department has compiled a winning record in challenging mergers since 2011, when it sued to stop AT&T from buying rival T-Mobile USA.

It has stopped at least one vertical merger by threatening to sue, specifically Lam Research Corp’s bid to buy KLA-Tencor Corp, which was abandoned under Justice Department pressure in 2016.

It had been widely expected that the AT&T deal would be approved by limiting how it managed content, known as a “behavioral” remedy, rather than asset sales.

Delrahim, in a speech at the American Bar Association last week, said that he opposed those sorts of remedies because they smacked of regulation and were ineffective and a drain on government resources.

“Behavioral remedies presume that the government should serve as a roving ombudsman of the affairs of business; even if we wanted to do that, we often don’t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,” he said.

Delrahim is not alone in those concerns.

“One reason for more concern about vertical deals is that behavioral remedies are falling out of favor because they do not work well,” said Steven Salop, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.","Delrahim dashed those hopes on Monday when the Justice Department sued AT&T, arguing that the U.S. No.

Even before Amazon.com (AMZN) bought mail-order pharmacy PillPack, there were rumors of its ambitions in the health-care space. Now, with the e-commerce giant is reportedly in talks with a startup called Xealth and at least two hospital networks, Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak argues that we have the next insight into Amazon's health-care strategy.

Ryan Adams

Amazon is said to be talking with Xealth and others about a pilot project that would allow doctors to pre-fill a basket of over-the-counter medical supplies that would be delivered to patients' homes after they're discharged from hospitals. In addition, Nowak writes, Amazon's posted a job opening for a position to lead outreach to medical-products manufacturers and service providers, first in the U.S. and then internationally.

The analyst writes that these discussions reinforce his earlier thesis that Amazon wants to enter the medical-supplies space, which represents $45 billion and $10 billion of revenue and gross profit, respectively, on the business-to-business side alone. Nowak argues that with PillPack, Amazon can strike a partnership with Xealth to create a ""one-stop private-label shop, without the stop."" That would create a recurring medical prescription and supply customer base, and Xealth could allow Amazon to grow its private-label commodity medical-supply business.

Of course, while that may sound exciting for Amazon shareholders, it may spell trouble for other companies. Nowak puts the exposures of medical-supplies distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) to Amazon's new foray at 10% of earnings before interest and taxes for each company. ""We view pricing as a key risk, with a 100 basis-points pricing concession translating to a 4%-5% EPS headwind for Cardinal and ~2% for McKesson.""

That said, McKesson services CVS Health's (CVS) Minute Clinic, a relationship that could expand once CVS's Aetna (AET) acquisition closes, which could offer some offset to Amazon-fueled margin pressure.

Amazon is up 0.8% to $1,809.53 this afternoon; the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) is 0.2% higher to $87.43.

48,"Nov 4, 2018",Home Health Care News,CVS Health Launches Effort to Make MinuteClinics More Senior Friendly,"Retail pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) wants to provide care that is specifically tailored to older adults in its MinuteClinic locations. To do so, CVS Health is partnering with one of the top-ranked research universities in the United States and plans to draw on care principles developed through the Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative.

CVS Health has made or been a part of several key moves with an eye toward America’s aging population. In October, the pharmacy giant secured anti-trust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of insurer Aetna (NYSE: AET), dependent on certain divesture requirements. This merger could support aging in place by making more health services easily accessible to people at locations close to their homes — namely, CVS pharmacies.

MinuteClinic, the retail medical clinic of Rhode Island-based CVS Health, is working with the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University to draw on the institution’s expertise in gerontology and educational knowhow. The collaboration — supported by a one-year planning grant of up to $945,000 from The John A. Hartford Foundation — will help support nurse practitioners and physician assistants who work in MinuteClinic locations across the country.

Th John A. Hartford Foundation support comes through its Age-Friendly Health Systems Initiative with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. The American Hospital Association and the Catholic Health Association of the United States are also part of the initiative.

“The Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative has become a movement to transform care for all of us as we age, thanks to our collaboration with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and our other partners,” Terry Fulmer, president of The John A. Hartford Foundation, said in a statement. “Through this new partnership with Case Western Reserve and CVS Health’s MinuteClinic, we have the tremendous opportunity to spread and scale the principles of Age-Friendly care to even more older adults in even more communities.”

The collaboration will work by placing a Case Western Reserve team in select MinuteClinic locations to help build out and execute on the Age-Friendly initiative’s cornerstone framework.

Mary Dolansky, associate professor and director of the Quality Safety Education for Nurses Institute at Case Western Reserve’s nursing school, will lead the project.

Case Western Reserve, CVS and partnering organizations plan to identify MinuteClinic sites across the country that serve a significant aging adult population as pilot locations for Age-Friendly care, with the eventual goal of expanding the program to all 1,100 U.S. MinuteClinic locations nationwide.

The collaboration will help train more than 2,900 nurse practitioners and physician assistants, according to Case Western Reserve.

Since launching, MinuteClinic has offered care through more than 42 million patient visits, according to Senior Vice President of CVS Health and Executive Director of MinuteClinic Sharon Vitti.

“Through our partnership with Case Western Reserve and IHI, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to further enhance quality, age-friendly care within our clinic,” Vitti said.

About 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, government statistics show. Roughly one-quarter of today’s 65-year-olds are projected to live past 90. Estimates indicate that by the year 2030, the U.S. will be home to 71 million people over age 65.

50,"Dec 19, 2017",,"Humana, pair of private equity firms will buy Kindred Healthcare for $4.1B","It’s official: Humana and two private equity firms will purchase Kindred Healthcare in a deal valued at about $4.1 billion.

Kindred made the announcement on Tuesday, not long after news had surfaced that the companies were in advanced discussions about the transaction.

As part of the deal, Kindred will spin off into two separate entities. One will be a standalone company composed of Kindred’s home health, hospice and community care businesses, which will be owned 40% by Humana and 60% by TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe. Over time, Humana will have the option of buying the remaining ownership in the company, which will be called Kindred at Home.

RELATED: With CVS set to buy Aetna, here's why Humana could be part of the next big insurer deal

The other spinoff will be a specialty hospital company owned by the two private equity firms. The new company, called Kindred Healthcare, will include long-term acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and contract rehabilitation services businesses and will be “uniquely positioned to care for the most medically complex and rehab-intensive populations,” Kindred President and CEO Benjamin Breier said in a statement.

For Humana, the deal “underscores the successful and ongoing execution of our strategy by joining with the most geographically diverse home healthcare provider in the country,” CEO Bruce Broussard said. Indeed, the insurer’s Humana At Home division already offers services like skilled nursing and in-home support to 1 million people.

“We are confident that these new capabilities will help Humana continue to modernize home health and meaningfully improve the member and provider experience,” Broussard added.

Per the terms of the deal, Breier will be the CEO of the specialty hospital company, while David Causby, who is the current president and executive vice president of Kindred at Home, will be the CEO of that entity when it becomes a standalone company. The transaction is expected to close next summer, provided it secures the necessary approvals from shareholders and regulators.

News of Humana’s purchase comes on the heels of speculation that the insurer is preparing to be acquired itself—possibly by fellow insurer Cigna. Such a deal could still happen, especially since UnitedHealth’s market dominance and CVS’ pending purchase of Aetna will put pressure on other insurers to grow larger and more diversified.","It’s official: Humana and two private equity firms will purchase Kindred Healthcare in a deal valued at about $4.1 billion.

51,"Nov 29, 2018",Business Wire,"A.M. Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Aetna, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries; Affirms Credit Ratings of SilverScript Insurance Company","OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A.M. Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICRs) of “a” of Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC) (Hartford, CT) and other operating entities of Aetna Inc. (Aetna) (headquartered in Hartford, CT) [NYSE: AET] following the announcement on Nov. 28, 2018, that CVS Health Corporation (CVS Health) has completed its acquisition of Aetna and its insurance subsidiaries. Concurrently, A.M. Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a” of SilverScript Insurance Company (SilverScript) (Nashville, TN), a subsidiary of CVS Health. Additionally, A.M. Best has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of “a-” of Coventry Health Plan of Florida, Inc. (Coventry HP of FL) (Sunrise, FL) and Aetna Insurance Company Limited (AICL) (United Kingdom). Lastly, A.M. Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” and the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) of Aetna. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Also, A.M. Best has withdrawn the Short-Term IR commercial paper rating of AMB-2 of Aetna, as the program has been terminated due to the merger with CVS Health.

Please see link below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.

The majority of Aetna’s operating entities are part of the core subsidiaries of Aetna Inc. (Aetna Health & Life Group). The ratings of Aetna Health & Life Group reflect its balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings of SilverScript reflect its balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM.

The ratings of Aetna Health & Life Group and SilverScript reflect high financial leverage of approximately 60% and high level of goodwill at the ultimate parent, CVS Health. In addition, there is a significant execution risk related to the Aetna-CVS Health merger given the vertical nature of the transaction and potential complexity to achieve meaningful synergies. However, CVS Health stated its intention to maintain the current capitalization level at the insurance entities and accelerate de-leveraging through robust cash flow and reduced share repurchases. Following the announcement of the transaction, Aetna and CVS Health stopped share repurchases. In 2017, Aetna’s and CVS Health’s share repurchases totaled $3.85 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.

Aetna Health & Life Group’s strong risk-adjusted capitalization is supported through a steady stream of positive earnings. However, year-end 2017 risk-adjusted capitalization at ALIC was at its lowest level in five years driven by a higher dividend to the parent and reduced value of deferred tax asset. The operating performance of Aetna’s insurance subsidiaries remains strong, with earnings supported by positive results in all lines of business and margins exceeding targets in 2017 and through the nine months of 2018. However, the exit from the individual business, combined with a loss of Medicaid contracts in several states, resulted in a material premium decline. Aetna is focused on maintaining stability of commercial group earnings while profitably expanding in government programs: Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care.

Aetna maintains a strong market presence throughout the United States in commercial and government segments. As a condition of the merger in order to satisfy the anti-trust concerns, Aetna agreed to sell all of its stand-alone Medicare Part D business to WellCare Health Plans Inc. It is not expected to impact Aetna’s operations significantly, as other Medicare products will not be affected. Aetna’s strategy of building effective partnerships with providers to deliver high quality and cost-effective care is supported by the build-out of an information technology platform to facilitate data-driven impacts on members’ behavior and lifestyle in order to control chronic health conditions. While Aetna’s insurance operation will remain a separate unit, the merger with CVS Health will provide further opportunities for vertical integration and outreach to members through increased local presence.

SilverScript has maintained very strong risk-adjusted capital levels over the past several years, supported by 100% retention of net income and an absence of dividend payments. Capital and surplus has shown consistent growth, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 28%. These positive balance sheet attributes are offset partially by potential liquidity concerns resulting from a high dependency on large program receivable balances, due to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reconciliation process and timing of payments. SilverScript has demonstrated a long-term trend of strong favorable earnings, with a five-year return on equity exceeding 20%. SilverScript is the market leader in stand-alone prescription drug plan enrollment; however, more than 50% of membership is composed of low-income subsidized members auto-assigned by CMS. Such concentration creates lack of product diversification and subjects SilverScript to a high degree of regulatory risks.

The ratings of AICL reflect its balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its marginal operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM. Furthermore, the ratings of AICL factor in rating enhancement from the Aetna organization. AICL has benefited from capital injections and the transfer of international business from the wider group.

A complete listing of Aetna Inc.’s FSRs, Long-Term ICRs and Long- and Short-Term IRs also is available.

Anthem’s play for Aspire Health, announced Wednesday, is the latest deal to further blur the lines between insurance companies and in-home care businesses.

The string of deals comes as insurers look to reduce costs by keeping patients at home and away from hospitals through more integrated operations along the continuum of care.

“Anthem is focused on enhancing our ability to offer innovative, integrated clinical care models that can improve the quality of healthcare and deliver better outcomes,” Anthem President and CEO Gail Boudreaux said in the announcement. “Aspire Health shares our perspective on the increasingly important role of integrated care and has built a unique model that provides palliative care and support services for patients and their families.”

Indianapolis-based Anthem and its affiliated companies provide products and services to more than 74 million people. Anthem’s Blue-licensed subsidiaries provide individual health benefits, life and disability products.

Aspire Health, co-founded in 2013 by Brad Smith and former U.S. Senator William Frist, currently provides services under contracts with more than 20 health plans to consumers in 25 states. Among its services, Aspire Health uses predictive algorithms to identify patient needs and, in turn, assign a team made up of physicians, nurses, social workers and chaplains who manage symptoms and coordinate care.

“Several studies have repeatedly demonstrated how advanced illness programs can provide high patient and family satisfaction, reduce hospitalization and decrease costs,” Smith, Aspire Health’s CEO, said. “As part of Anthem, we believe we will be able to further scale our model and positively impact the lives of even more consumers and families, making home-based advanced illness care available to patients who need it.”

Anthem’s acquisition of Aspire Health is expected to close in the third quarter. The transaction is projected to be neural to Anthem’s 2018 earnings and accretive come 2019, according to the company.

55,"Aug 21, 2018",Senior Housing News,"CVS, Competitors Vie for Senior Living Pharmacy Market Share","Pharmacy giant CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) recently announced an aggressive push to serve assisted living providers through its Omnicare arm. But CVS is competing with specialized pharmacies serving the senior living sector—and this could be good news for senior living providers, as it could spur more innovative pharmacy distribution and management practices.

Some assisted living providers, such as Marquis Companies, already offer in-house pharmacy services to their residents, but those providers are not the majority. Two-thirds of assisted living providers which offer ancillary services reported using a third-party pharmacy provider, according to a recent online survey from the American Seniors Housing Association (ASHA).

And a significant proportion of these providers already are working with CVS/Omnicare, which claims a 50% market penetration rate.

Some major industry players see growth opportunities in assisted living communities. For example, CVS—which in 2015 acquired what was then the nation’s largest long-term care pharmacy provider, Omnicare—is looking to improve its presence with assisted and independent living providers in the months ahead.

“Our enterprise product development team is rapidly innovating improved solutions to effectively serve this market and to substantially grow our penetration rate from approximately 50% to 70%,” David Denton, executive vice president and CFO with CVS Health, said during the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 8. “Our initial solutions have produced success in some markets. And we’re looking to scale those up across our assisted living book of business.”

Omnicare has struggled since the CVS buyout, particularly with regard to its skilled nursing business. The long-term care pharmacy has in recent times grappled with longer collection times on receivables, a faster-than-expected decline in facility reimbursement rates, and lower client retention rates.

“Bed census at skilled nursing facilities continued to track lower, resulting in fewer prescriptions across our platform,” Denton continued during the earnings call. “And, despite a growing opportunity in the assisted living market, our programs to serve these clients have grown more slowly than we originally anticipated.”

To help grow the assisted living side of its business moving forward, CVS is implementing a range of initiatives that include rolling out “assisted living centers of excellence” and investing in new ways to work directly with community managers and their residents.

CVS declined to elaborate on the company’s plans when reached by Senior Housing News.

Recommended SHN+ Exclusives

PharMerica also declined comment when reached by SHN. Owned in part by Walgreens, PharMerica is another large pharmacy provider to the senior living sector.

Large-scale opportunity

Senior living represents a sizable potential market segment for pharmacy providers, according to Cece Credille, senior vice president of quality services at Enlivant, told SHN. Chicago-based Enlivant manages and owns about 240 properties, with more than 10,400 assisted living units.

The company works with Omnicare, along with other pharmacies, to meet its residents’ medication needs.

“It’s primarily private-pay for room and board, and obviously it’s still a lot of Medicare Part D or insurance coverage for the medication, but because it’s congregate living, that should be appealing to these large [pharmacy] providers,” Credille told SHN.

Assisted living isn’t the only potential senior living market for pharmacies, Credille added.

“There’s an opportunity for these pharmacies in independent living, as well,” she explained “That’s a whole other market segment. And you think about how big some of these communities are, I think there’s a lot of opportunity there.”

Like Omnicare and Medication Management Partners, Baltimore-based long-term care pharmacy Remedi SeniorCare also sees the benefit of serving the senior living marketplace.

Remedi currently operates in 30 states and Washington, D.C., and works with about 1,000 long-term care facilities and senior living communities, including Enlivant. About 40% of the pharmacy’s clients are assisted living communities.

“The increase in senior living growth through new development or acquisitions will always represent a growth potential for Remedi,” Libby McDonald senior vice president of account services at Remedi, told SHN. “Our steady, responsible growth focuses on positioning our pharmacies in markets to efficiently service multiple communities in the state and neighboring states.”

Challenges and trends

That senior living pharmacy opportunity won’t come without some challenges, however. For instance, pharmacy providers that are more accustomed to serving skilled nursing facilities will have to make some adjustments, Credille emphasized.

“You can’t drop in the medication system that worked for so long in skilled nursing and still does, it’s just not the same customer relationship with the residents and families,” she said. “The payer source for skilled is all Medicare Part A, so there’s little interface with the customer. The difference in assisted living is the end user who is paying the co-pays, and the ‘donut hole’ is the customer, the resident, or their families.”

Some macro trends, such as the senior living industry moving toward electronic health records (EHRs), will also affect pharmacies that serve the industry, noted McDonald. In particular, changing regulations, provider development and growth, and resident acuity will create new challenges, and new opportunities, for pharmacies.

“Continued collaboration between nursing facilities, [long-term care] pharmacy operators, and EHR providers is necessary to find ways to streamline the communication process, make nurses’ jobs more efficient and reduce opportunities for errors,” McDonald said.

The differences between assisted living and other senior care settings has given rise to some pharmacy companies that focus on the private-pay sector. Crestwood, Illinois-based Medication Management Partners is one example, and CEO Labinot Avdiu believes that this focus gives it a competitive edge.

Medication Management Partners services 5,500 residents in four states from its Illinois headquarters (pictured above). Some of the company’s clients include Chicago-based Pathway to Living and Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based New Perspective Senior Living.

While regulatory constraints and reimbursement pressures are generally a senior living pharmacy’s two biggest challenges, there are also big opportunities in emerging technologies such as telepharmacy and pharmacogenomics—or the ability to provide a customized pharmaceutical care plan based on someone’s genetic makeup—Avdiu said.

Another industry trend to watch in the years ahead is consolidation, he added.

“The world of health care providers is rapidly consolidating, in almost every segment of the health care industry,” he said. “[It’s] hard to predict what will happen in the next decade, but the current trends seem to indicate less players in the future, not more.”

CVS itself is a prime example of this trend. The company is in the midst of trying to tie up with one of the nation’s largest insurance providers, Aetna (NYSE: AET).

And CVS isn’t the only one. Another major pharmacy retailer, Walmart, was rumored to be interested in acquiring a major insurer in Humana (NYSE: HUM). The trend is also playing out at Amazon, which in June acquired pharmacy startup PillPack for just under $1 billion. This has spurred talk that the e-commerce giant wants to reinvent the way that people manage and purchase their medications, with some speculation that drones could soon drop pills onto people’s porches.

But despite all these uncertainties, there may be room for a variety of pharmacy players to flourish in the senior living space, considering demographic trends.

“The population is aging, so the continued growth of the senior living industry is something that most expect will continue,” Medication Management Partners CEO Labinot Avdiu told SHN. “There is good competition and growth in the industry, so in my view, the available market-share is healthy.”

Written by Tim Regan","Pharmacy giant CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) recently announced an aggressive push to serve assisted living providers through its Omnicare arm.
But CVS is competing with specialized pharmacies serving the senior living sector—and this could be good news for senior living providers, as it could spur more innovative pharmacy distribution and management practices.
Some assisted living providers, such as Marquis Companies, already offer in-house pharmacy services to their residents, but those providers are not the majority.

56,"Jun 4, 2018",MarketWatch,Walgreens may be building the store of the future in Florida — but Wall Street is skeptical,"CVS Health Corp. is buying Aetna Inc., while Cigna Corp. is snapping up Express Scripts Holding Co. As health-care companies vertically integrate with high-priced deals across varied parts of the industry’s supply chain, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -0.53% , its acquisition of rival Rite Aid’s RAD, -1.41% nearly 2,000 stores now complete, remains alone at the party.

Industry watchers have noticed — company shares have plummeted nearly 23% over the past year — and want to know what’s next. Answers, though, are scarce.

At a recent sell-side event, “management highlighted the company was focused on a new strategy for the stores, but would not share any details on the strategy for competitive reasons,” said Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes, describing it as “strange” and “a bit puzzling.”

The company suggested that more details might be available in the next year, she said.

Of course, there’s no guarantee that big-ticket mergers elsewhere will be successful. Many are seemingly motivated by industry-wide consolidation, or describe vague, if lofty, goals.

But they do put pressure on Walgreens to articulate a long-term strategy, especially one that distinguishes it from its rivals.

Walgreens shares have dropped nearly 23% over the last year, more than its rivals. The company acquired nearly 2,000 of rival Rite Aid’s stores as other companies pursued vertical mergers.

The company has been offering more health-care services, including hearing, eye care and clinical lab testing, in 17 stores in Gainesville, Fla., according to Wall Street analysts present at last week’s sell-side analyst day.

This suggests a goal of becoming a health-care hub, said Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen, though “few details were provided around the results that these new stores are seeing, the costs of the store investments, and what exactly changed in those locations.”

Moreover, Walgreens doesn’t plan to add more clinics or urgent-care centers, so “it is unclear to us how WBA will truly transform the way in which care is delivered in their local communities,” Larsen said.

A “store of the future” that transforms consumer health also sounds a lot like the CVS-Aetna CVS, -0.93% US:AET deal’s ambitions.

57,"Dec 11, 2017",CBS News,"Providence St. Joseph Health, Ascension in merger talks: report","Hospital operators Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are in talks to merge in a deal that would create the nation's largest hospital chain, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing an unnamed source. The combined entity would have almost $45 billion a year in revenue, according to the paper.

Both Ascension, which is based in St. Louis, and Providence, in Washington State, are nonprofits. That status makes them exempt from paying some taxes, but also requires them to offer services that benefit their communities.

A merger of the two would create a chain of 191 hospitals across 27 states, larger than the current top hospital operator, Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). HCA has 177 hospitals and had $41.5 billion in revenue last year, according to Modern Healthcare.

The move in the latest in a tussle between insurers and hospitals for market share. Earlier this year, a planned merger between health insurers Aetna and Humana was blocked by a federal court.

In another proposed combination that is shaking up the industry, Aetna (AET) and CVS (CVS) announced a merger earlier this month that would form a $69 billion health care company. That deal represents a deeper move into consumer care for CVS, which runs over a thousand walk-in clinics inside its stores and is the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager in the nation.

Amazon (AMZN) is also showing signs of moving into the pharmacy business, receiving pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states.

The national coverage decision opens DRG treatment to some 22 million Aetna members, Abbott said. Aetna already covers treatment with Abbott’s spinal cord stimulation devices, the company said. It acquired the neurostim assets when it paid $25 billion for St. Jude Medical back in January 2017.

“Since its launch in the U.S., Abbott’s DRG stimulation has had a profound impact for people living with complex pain conditions. One of the most challenging stories we hear is when patients undergo a therapy trial, find pain relief and then learn their insurance won’t cover their therapy,” neuromodulation VP Keith Boettiger said in prepared remarks. “While Medicare already covers our DRG system, it’s encouraging to see private payers like Aetna review the clinical data and outcomes, then choose to provide access to DRG stimulation for their members. These decisions build on the momentum of broader national coverage decisions by private insurers and support the FDA’s goals to find new ways to combat the opioid epidemic with alternatives such as Abbott’s neurostimulation therapies.”

59,"Aug 22, 2018",,Why Lowe's is closing stores and slashing inventory,"Lowe's is slimming down to better compete with Home Depot.

The company, which recently hired Marvin Ellison away from JCPenney (JCP) to be its CEO, said it is shutting down its Orchard Supply Hardware stores and plans to slash inventory at its Lowe's stores.

The home improvement retailer did report earnings that topped forecasts on Wednesday, thanks to a healthy housing market. Shares surged more than 7% in early trading on the news.

Related: Sears is closing another 46 stores

But Lowe's (LOW) cut its sales and profit outlook for the year.

The retailer is playing catch-up to industry leader Home Depot (HD), which just last week reported strong results.

Sales at Lowe's stores open at least one year rose 5.3% in the second quarter. That sounds impressive until you consider that Home Depot's sales were up more than 8%.

Ellison appears unafraid to make some big changes to help Lowe's become more competitive.

The company said Wednesday that the 99 Orchard Supply Hardware stores that Lowe's owns in California, Oregon and Florida, as well as a distribution center, will be shut down by the end of the fiscal year.

Orchard Supply Hardware has 4,300 employees. Ellison said in the earnings release that the chain's workers will be given ""priority status"" if they apply for other jobs at Lowe's and will also receive job placement assistance and severance.

Lowe's bought Orchard Supply Hardware only five years ago for $205 million.

The company said Wednesday its earnings were cut by $230 million as a result of the planned closings. Lowe's also expects to incur an additional $390 to $475 million in costs in the second half of the year related to the closings.

That's one of the reasons for the weaker guidance. But Lowe's is also planning to shake up the product offerings in its stores -- which will hurt sales in the short-term.

Ellison said Lowe's will ""aggressively rationalize store inventory"" and cut back on lower-performing items.

And if all that wasn't enough, Lowe's announced Wednesday it was hiring David Denton, currently the chief financial officer of CVS (CVS), to be its new CFO.

Lowe's said Denton will join the company after CVS completes its acquisition of insurer Aetna (AET), which is expected to close sometime before the end of the year. Lowe's current CFO, Marshal Croom, plans to retire in October.

The hiring of Denton is the latest in a series of executive shakeups that have taken place since Ellison joined Lowe's.

In July, Ellison announced a restructuring of the C-suite, saying that the company was eliminating the chief operating officer and chief customer officer positions as well as several other senior leadership positions.","The company, which recently hired Marvin Ellison away from JCPenney (JCP) to be its CEO, said it is shutting down its Orchard Supply Hardware stores and plans to slash inventory at its Lowe's stores.

60,"Jun 13, 2018",MarketWatch,"AT&T wins court approval to buy Time Warner, paving path to more mergers","AT&T Inc. won approval from a U.S. court on Tuesday to buy Time Warner Inc. in one of the largest antitrust cases in decades.

The high-stakes case, which was decided by Richard Leon, a judge appointed by President George W. Bush, has been closely watched by the telecommunications, media, and tech industries for its potential effect on the future of other blockbuster deals.

“This opens the floodgates for consolidation among the largest entertainment and transmission companies,” said Gene Kimmelman, former chief counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division.

The Justice Department filed suit to block the $85.4 billion acquisition deal last November, claiming such a deal would hurt consumers and competition. At the time, Makan Delrahim, chief of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said: “This merger would greatly harm American consumers. It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy.”

AT&T general counsel David McAtee said the company was “pleased” with the court decision and looked forward to “closing the merger on or before June 20 so we can begin to give consumers video entertainment that is more affordable, mobile, and innovative.”

Tuesday’s ruling doesn’t only give the green light to AT&T’s T, +0.56% acquisition of Time Warner US:TWX, which owns HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. movie and television studios. Other companies with large deals in the making, such as CVS CVS, -0.93% and its bid for Aetna US:AET, and T-Mobile TMUS, -0.78% and its proposed merger with Sprint S, +3.12% can now point to Tuesday’s ruling to support their cases with regulators.

The court decision will also open the door to a bidding war between Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.29% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +4.04% for some of 21st Century Fox Inc.’s FOXA, +1.67% most coveted assets in a deal that would be a similar vertical merging of content and distribution.

In December, Fox agreed to sell its entertainment assets to Walt Disney Co. for $52.4 billion in stock. The assets in question include the Twentieth Century Fox TV and film studios, cable networks including FX and National Geographic Channel, Star India, a 39% stake in Sky PLC and majority control of streaming service Hulu. However, cable giant and NBCUniversal owner Comcast Corp. has since confirmed it is preparing to submit a cash bid that will top Disney’s all-stock offer.

AT&T, Time Warner and the Entire Media Merger Frenzy Explained

21st Century Fox Inc. shareholders plan to vote July 10 on the company’s proposed sale of some of its highly-prized assets to Walt Disney Co., though Fox said the meeting could be postponed if Comcast submits a competing bid.

Fox previously rejected an offer from Comcast for its entertainment assets due to antitrust concerns. That offer was 16% more on a per-share basis than what Walt Disney agreed to pay. Tuesday’s ruling may relieve Fox’s concerns and leave the field clear for a bidding war between the two companies.

Fox and News Corp, publisher of MarketWatch and The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.

This is a rare acquisition opportunity for Disney and Comcast. Streaming is a key part of Disney’s long-term strategy. The company paid nearly $2.6 billion for a majority stake in streaming-technology company BamTech last year and in April launched a sports streaming service, ESPN+. Disney is also planning to end its distribution deal with Netflix NFLX, +0.46% in favor of launching its own subscription service in 2019.

When it comes to streaming content, “Netflix is still miles ahead,” said Daniel Ives, the head of technology research at GBH Insights. Acquiring the Fox assets, which include such big-name franchises as “X-Men” and “Ice Age,” would “take Disney from the 50- to the 20-yard line,” he said. Acquiring the Fox assets would add valuable movies and shows to Disney’s future subscription service, and would give Disney a majority interest in Hulu.

Comcast is also making inroads in streaming, joining with Netflix in recent years. After a failed attempt to create its own streaming-video service in 2012, Comcast reached an agreement in 2016 with the streaming juggernaut to allow Netflix subscribers access to Netflix content on Comcast’s X1 cable boxes. And in April, the two companies announced that Comcast would begin bundling Netflix with its plans for cable TV, phone and internet, allowing customers to pay for both Netflix and Comcast services on one bill.

Despite these moves, Comcast still faces a saturated pay-TV market in the U.S. Acquiring Fox’s international assets would create opportunities in parts of the world where cable TV still has ample room to grow.","AT&T Inc. won approval from a U.S. court on Tuesday to buy Time Warner Inc. in one of the largest antitrust cases in decades.

61,"Jan 8, 2018",Home Health Care News,How Amazon Could Take On Home Care,"Amazon (NYSE: AMZN) is entering the health care market, and its momentum could carry the retail giant into the home care space.

Watching Amazon’s actions and guessing at next steps has become a spectator sport, and as the home health care space is in the midst of a major consolidation period, industry players are looking for opportunities to both benefit from Amazon and defend from potential competition.

Health care entry

It’s the ability to bring a better experience to customers that has driven Amazon’s big moves in retail, including its recent acquisition of Whole Foods, and will continue to motivate the company if it enters the health care space. That’s according to Brittain Ladd, an independent supply chain consultant and former Amazon employee. Ladd formerly worked on Amazon’s grocery distribution chain and is not involved in Amazon’s current activity.

“Amazon is taking a look at the entire grocery industry and saying, ‘What can we do to provide a better customer experience?’” he told HHCN. “[They] started with online and now they have stores, but Amazon will always be asking, ‘What else can we do?’ That can be applied to the health care and pharmacy industry. They may start small, but make no mistake, they will be asking what else can we do, and how.”

Health care stakeholders got their first glimpse at Amazon’s discreet movement into the industry when it was uncovered the retail giant had acquired wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in October 2017. However, the extent of Amazon’s plans, whether in pharmacy or health care more broadly, remain unclear. Amazon did not respond to multiple media inquiries from Home Health Care News for this article.

Amazon has taken certain steps, though: It also quietly added to its growing label of private label drugs to include over-the-counter drugs with “Basic Care,” a newly-launched product line that is a registered trademark of manufacturer Perrigo (NYSE: PRGO), according to a December research note from Raymond James. Perrigo has been selling its OTC drug on Amazon for years under its “Good Sense” label, and a sample set of the Basic Care products reveals the products are cheaper, much cheaper in some cases, than at competitors like CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), Raymond James stated. Though the financial services company isn’t ringing any alarm bells for its “Sky is Falling Freakout-o-meter,” the move marks an increasing competitive threat for existing pharma players, according to the note.

Others are also certain that Amazon will enter health care generally through pharmacy, potentially by acquiring a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company, or a third-party administrator of prescription drug plans. Amazon “will almost certainly enter the drug distribution value chain within two years,” a Leerink Partners research note dated October 6, 2017, predicted.

Major players with community-based services have recently made moves that are apparently motivated, in part, by the need to defend against Amazon. CVS recently announced it was acquiring health insurance giant Aetna (NYSE: AET) in a $69 billion deal. The transaction essentially shuts out Amazon from Aetna customers if it were to become a pharmacy provider, and also solidifies that CVS and Aetna will expand home- and community-based services.

If Amazon were to become a full service PBM, as expected, the impact on home health care wouldn’t be much, though some providers could see it as another opportunity to offer better services and lower prices for clients.

“I don’t think they would impact us,” Mike Magid, COO of home care provider Griswold Home Care, said of the potential pharma entry. “If anything, if they got into pharma, it would be another avenue we could explore from a pricing point. Our goal as a home care company is to keep programs in front of clients and caregivers that are free or extremely affordable.”

Home health worries

Recommended HHCN+ Exclusives

As Amazon looks to possibly capture some of the market share in the pharmacy space, home care providers are keeping watch on the company for other reasons.

Coupled with its home-based voice technology, Amazon’s Echo product could easily be paired with home health and home care services to fulfill a number of responsibilities for seniors needing care. And some home care and home health providers are already actively exploring these options, including California-based Libertana Home Health, which tapped Amazon’s Alexa for a pilot study with some of its clients.

“When it comes to home health, I don’t see Amazon employing health aides in the home,” Scott Barclay, partner and leader of the computational care practice at Data Collective, an early stage deep tech venture capital firm, told HHCN. “That said, I do think the home health agency model, which is broken, is ripe for further innovation (like Honor, like Carelinx), and I think the proliferation of Amazon’s Alexa- and Google Home-type audio devices will further accelerate new and seamless Uber-like ordering of services for people aging in place. So, these trends are impactful even if Amazon does not per se go after home health or senior care.”

As far as providing services, Amazon already directly offers home cleaning services from its website, and other services aren’t far behind. While Barclay disagrees, some do see Amazon going even further in the future and possibly entering home care directly.

“I absolutely think it’s a possibility,” Ladd said. “What you would have to look at is what is a sweet spot of Amazon – the ability to meet the needs of customers in their home, the last mile capability. A customer they can deliver to at home.”

In addition, an Amazon employee in the company’s “general and non-acute health care division” was recently registered to attend the National Association for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC) annual conference in Fall 2017.

Not everyone thinks Amazon is up to becoming a provider, or even a platform for home care services. Instead, Amazon is more likely to stick to the retail side of health care, rather than services.

“I’m not concerned about the [health of the] home health industry or [Amazon] getting into the temporary labor space,” Paul Kusserow, CEO of Baton Rouge-based Amedisys (Nasdaq: AMED), told HHCN. “They’ve stayed away from that in the past. We’ve seen them look at this before, but they stay very very much to inert products, pills, anything in the mail to be boxed and shipped. They do a really good job and are efficient at it.”

Healthy competition

Even if home health care providers are not directly challenged by Amazon entering health care, the indirect implications could still be there, as providers, distributors and other stakeholders mobilize to prepare for – or keep up with – Amazon. The competition Amazon would create by entering health care in a significant way could cause pain for some established players, but it could also spur a new wave of innovation.

“By reputation and by proof and past track record, Amazon does a great job when they enter a new industry,” Ladd said. “There’s nothing wrong with that – competition is a good thing and that’s what health care will do. Amazon will challenge everyone else. …It’s good for customers and good for the entire industry.”

62,"Dec 13, 2017",Nasdaq,PBM Industry Shows Strength: 3 Stocks in Focus,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.

Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.

As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in 'The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers' by Orszag and Green).

Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.

Factors Driving PBM

Historically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.

We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).

The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.

Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.

Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry's revenues in 2016.

Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM Landscape

The PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS' merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health CVS , had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna AET .

People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health's PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.

Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company - Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group UNH - announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. DVA .

Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. WMT might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. HUM to counter competition.

3 Stocks to Scoop Up

As the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.

CVS Health : Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.

Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA , as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS' PBM customers.

Express ScriptsESRX : Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.

Notably, the company's PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.

The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider - eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.

Rite Aid CorporationRAD : Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.

Notably, the company's Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.

64,"Dec 29, 2017",Nasdaq,15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can't help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.

While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.

The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC , and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.

Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.

The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.

1. Amazon Buys Whole Foods

Earlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.

2. Intel Acquires Mobileye

Intel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.

3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell Collins

In a major industry deal, United Technologies UTX agreed to buy Rockwell Collins COL for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.

4. Disney To Buy Some of 21 st Century Fox's Assets

Just a few weeks ago, Disney DIS and 21 st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse's parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate's assets, including the film studio 20 th Century Fox, the company's TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA's stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.

5. JAB Holdings Acquires Panera

For $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet's Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.

6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo

""Affordable"" luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo's footprint. This likely won't be Kors' last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, ""luxury group.""

7. Coach Buys Kate Spade

Coach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR , shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers-it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez-and to rebrand itself as a broader ""lifestyle assortment company.""

8. CVS Buys Aetna

After weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna AET for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS's 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

9. Gilead Acquires Kite Pharma

In October, Gilead Sciences GILD shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.

10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoft

In a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco CSCO paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft BSFT , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub ""the future of work,"" as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.

11. Apple Buys Shazam

Recently, iPhone maker Apple AAPL confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app's augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.

12. Arby's Roark Buys Buffalo Wild Wings

Just last month, Arby's owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby's has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby's will also assume the debt of BWLD.

13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.

The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines-based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens , Family Circle , and Shape , among others, while Time owns T ime , People , Sports Illustrated , Fortune , Entertainment Weekly , and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.

14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks Interactive

In November, Discovery's DISCA $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive SNI received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp's portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.

15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone Team

This fall, Alphabet's GOOGL Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC's mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC's team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.

More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

66,"Apr 26, 2018",Home Health Care News,"ProMedica to Blur Acute, Post-Acute Lines with ManorCare Deal","The acquisition of HCR ManorCare, the nation’s second-largest skilled nursing provider, by nonprofit health system ProMedica falls in line with a growing trend of payors and providers building out their care continuum, with one goal being to treat patients more frequently in lower-cost care settings like home health care.

On late Wednesday night, ProMedica announced it was acquiring the operations of HCR ManorCare, including its home heath and hospice business, for $1.35 billion. In a joint venture deal with heath care real estate investment trust (REIT) Welltower Inc. (NYSE: WELL) ProMedica is also acquiring a 20% stake in the company’s real estate assets, with Welltower owning the remaining percentage. Separately, Welltower is also acquiring ManorCare’s landlord, Quality Care Properties (QCP).

The venture greatly expands ProMedica’s footprint in the post acute care space, doubling its revenue to more than $7 billion and adding about 100 home health care locations in 23 states.

The transaction will establish ProMedia as one of the 15 largest nonprofit health systems in the country and the largest health system operator of private-pay senior housing.

The deal follows similar moves by other health care giants: Humana (NYSE: HUM) recently announced it is acquiring the home health and hospice operations of Kindred Healthcare (NYSE: KND) and Curo Hospice. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) also recently launched their own health care play to lower health care costs for their employees and push for low-cost care settings. Another recent deal between CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) and Aetna (NYSE: AET) focused on expanding community-based services.

“Now that the whole health care delivery model is changing, they need to rationalize that and look for other ways to bring their health care delivery to lower cost, more modern settings—that is the entire theme of what you are seeing happening,” Tom DeRosa, CEO of Welltower, said during the company’s first quarter earnings call Thursday. “Whether it’s what Humana is doing, whether its Berkshire, Amazon and JPMorgan, health care delivery is being disrupted.”

The structure of the deal—which brings together a not-for-profit health system, a health care REIT, and a post-acute care provider—is being touted as “transformative” and the first of its kind in the space, according to Welltower executives.

ProMedica similarly sees the deal as transformative, but not just because of its structure.

“We see the lines in health care, clinical care have really blurred,” CEO Randy Oostra told HHCN Thursday. “We’re hoping to blur that further, between the line of acute and post acure [care].”

The deal is happening at a particularly strenuous time for the skilled using industry, with HCR ManorCare’s home health and hospice business being a bright spot on its earnings and revenue over the last year. The profitability of the home health business was one draw for ProMedica, Oona told HHCN.

“I’d say the home health and hospice business is certainly attractive,” Chad Vanacore, analyst with Stifel, told Home Health Care News. “Both home health and hospice [are] attractive assets with growing demand, and certainly will [command a] premium valuation in the market.”

As part of the deal, ManorCare CEO Steve Cavanaugh is the CEO will stay on in his role, with Matt Kang continuing to serve as chief financial officer, according to a memo sent to employees Thursday.

67,"Jun 23, 2020",Kiplinger,5 Hot-Running Health Insurance Stocks to Buy,"Many of us are unhappy with our health insurers. Premiums are high. Hospital bills can be large and deductibles for many policyholders are larger than ever. But the world looks good if you own health insurance stocks. There are profits to be made managing government health care programs — Medicaid, public exchanges, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Medicare. Because despite the confusion over health insurance, government health care expenditures continue to rise. To wit, Medicare spending is projected grow 7.9% annually to 2023 with total expenditures of approximately $1.1 trillion. Meanwhile, Medicaid spending is estimated to grow 5.9% annually to 2023, when it will top $828 billion. Here are five health insurance stocks to buy – all of which have advanced by double digits already in 2018. But don’t worry about being late to the party. There’s reason to expect more upside in these stocks because they need only to maintain a strategy at which they have proven adept: increase enrollments and contain medical costs. Data is as of Oct. 15, 2018. Companies are listed in alphabetical order.

Centene Market value: $29.6 billion No one paid much attention when Centene (CNC, $139.42) joined the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2014. But now it is the largest ACA player with 1.6 million marketplace members and continues to earn substantial profits from this program. Centene is no one-trick pony, however. It wins about 81% of the Medicaid contracts it bids on, based on an analysis by Wells Fargo analysts. Success in gaining new business has showed up on the top and bottom lines alike. Last year’s earnings grew to $5.03 per share, up from $4.43 in 2016. But there’s more growth to come for this health insurance stock, say Bank of America analysts, who estimate 2018 EPS of $6.95 on eye-popping revenues of $69 billion.

Humana Market value: $44.8 billion Humana (HUM, $317.01) is a well-known health insurer. Humana’s balance sheet includes almost $19 billion in cash against just $5.3 billion in total debt, enabling the company to manage the twists and turns of the health care business in the U.S., and capitalize on the opportunities these twists and turns create. Regarding the latter: In April, Humana teamed up with private equity players TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe to purchase hospice provider Curo for $1.4 billion. That deal followed Human’s $4 billion acquisition of Kindred at Home, which when combined with Curo created the nation’s largest hospice provider. Before and shortly after CVS Health (CVS) announced its acquisition of Aetna (AET) in December of last year, there was speculation that Humana might be the next takeover target. Since then, however, that spotlight has come off Humana, and instead, the health insurance company is eyeing stronger ties with Walmart (WMT); the two companies currently have a prescription drug partnership. While these machinations play out, Humana’s Medicare Advantage continues to grow rapidly. In August, Humana raised its adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2018 from to approximately $14.15 from its previous range of $13.70 to $14.10. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analysts expect Humana to benefit from a recent increase in Medicare Advantage rates.

Molina Healthcare Market value: $8.8 billion Molina Healthcare (MOH, $138.57) is a managed care insurer that focuses on Medicaid. The growth in Medicaid is compelling (for insurers, but likely not for taxpayers), with government expenditures of $566 billion in 2016 projected to expand to $696 billion in 2020. Molina reported second-quarter earnings in August that benefited from downsizing, improved productivity and debt reduction. Based on these improvements, management raised its EPS guidance substantially, from a range of $4-$4.50 per share to $7.39-$7.59, or an increase of 68%-85% on the higher and lower ends, respectively. It’s not just Medicaid spending that is fueling optimism behind Molina and similar health insurance stocks. In 2017, a management shake-up resulted in Molina’s board letting go of CEO J. Mario Molina and CFO John Molina, the sons of founder C. David Molina. Joseph M. Zubretsky, former CEO of Hanover Insurance, took the reins during the fourth quarter of that year, and the company’s progress under his leadership during Q1 and Q2 of this year has been material.

UnitedHealth Group Market value: $259.0 billion UnitedHealth Group (UNH, $260.25) is the largest health insurer in the United States, and the bulk of its business is tied to government programs that are growing at healthy rates. The stock has regularly hit new highs this year and is up 21% year-to-date. About 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 daily and qualify for Medicare, which is UnitedHealth’s largest business segment, accounting for $66 billion of its $163 billion in revenues last year. UnitedHealth’s fastest-growing business, which it calls UnitedHealthcare Community & State, is tied to Medicaid spending (which is growing around 6% annually). Between 2015 and 2017, Community & State revenues jumped 29%, from $28.9 billion to $37.4 billion. These businesses are important because the employers and individual insurance division shrunk between 2016 and 2017, though it remains above 2015 levels. Analysts are bullish on UNH because of its diversified product line, which they feel will enable it to adapt to changing government regulations and seize growth opportunities as they appear.","But the world looks good if you own health insurance stocks.

68,"Nov 6, 2017",Reuters,"Anthem top executive Swedish to become adviser, Boudreaux named CEO","(Reuters) - Anthem Inc's ANTM.N Joseph Swedish will be replaced as chief executive by industry veteran Gail Boudreaux but will stay on as executive chairman until May 2018 and be a senior adviser through May 2020, the health insurer said on Monday.

People enter the office building of health insurer Anthem in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news on Friday.

Swedish will continue to receive his current salary as executive chairman and be eligible for a prorated bonus and as an adviser, he will be paid $4.5 million per year.

Swedish's move comes at a time of change for Anthem, the No. 2 U.S. health insurer. The company cut Obamacare individual market participation by 70 percent for next year and recently announced plans to bring its pharmacy benefit management in house. It also may face a much larger Aetna Inc AET.N, which is considering a deal with CVS Health Corp CVS.N, according to sources.

Boudreaux was most recently CEO of United Healthcare, a unit of the biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N. Before that, she was an executive at the next largest operator of Blue Cross Blue Shield licensed insurers, Health Care Services Corp, and at Aetna.

BMO Markets analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note that Boudreaux is held in high regard by investors but that Anthem’s stock is still a “market-perform” given the company’s slower-growth business mix.

“We expect there may be a period of uncertainty among investors until the reasons for the reported leadership change are understood and fully accepted by the market,” he wrote.

Boudreaux, who will take on the role of CEO on Nov. 20, will receive an annual salary of $1.4 million with a potential bonus of up to 350 percent of her salary, along with an initial stock grant worth $2 million. Long-term incentives are worth up to $10.25 million.

Swedish orchestrated Anthem's $54 billion deal for smaller rival Cigna Corp CI.N in 2015, which was ultimately scrapped as regulators said that and Aetna's proposed acquisition of Humana Inc HUM.N would be anti-competitive.

Two weeks ago, news broke that Aetna and CVS were in talks over a deal that would create a combined health insurance, pharmacy benefit management, and pharmacy company. The deal is expected in December, Reuters reported.

The impact of that deal is unclear on Anthem's recently announced plan to use CVS to help manage its pharmacy benefits business as it exits its contract with Express Scripts Holding ESRX.O.","(Reuters) - Anthem Inc's ANTM.N Joseph Swedish will be replaced as chief executive by industry veteran Gail Boudreaux but will stay on as executive chairman until May 2018 and be a senior adviser through May 2020, the health insurer said on Monday.

69,"Apr 23, 2018",Reuters,"Humana, PE firms to buy hospice operator Curo Health for $1.4 billion","(Reuters) - Humana Inc HUM.N is teaming up with two private equity firms to buy privately held Curo Health Services for about $1.4 billion, the group's second such deal in five months that will create the largest hospice operator in the United States.

The consortium, which includes TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, will merge Curo with the hospice business of Kindred Healthcare Inc KND.N, which it agreed to buy in December for about $810 million.

This is the latest deal in a rapidly consolidating healthcare sector, with companies looking for new ways to bolster profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs.

Reuters reported last month that Walmart Inc WMT.N was in early-stage talks with Humana for developing closer ties, with the acquisition of Humana being discussed as one possibility.

“We view the (Curo) acquisition as financially prudent for Humana but without a majority ownership position, achieving its operational goals could be more challenging,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper wrote in a note.

The deal indicates that Humana should not be viewed as a takeover target, Halper added, saying that a deeper relationship between Humana and Walmart is entirely possible.

Humana’s insurance business is focused on individuals in the U.S. government’s Medicare program for the elderly and the disabled. The deals builds on Humana’s focus on using healthcare providers in members’ homes to improve patient care and save costs.

Soaring healthcare costs have been a national issue, and the federal government has been restricting spending for healthcare, putting pressure on insurers.

Last year, Aetna Inc AET.N announced a $69 billion deal to be bought by CVS Health Corp CVS.N, fueling interest in how smaller rival Humana will compete.

70,"Apr 9, 2018",Kiplinger,10 Dividends That Are Slowing to a Screeching Halt,"Like clockwork, a core appeal of dividend growth investing is receiving steadily higher payouts each and every year. Rising income can help retirees combat cost-of-living increases, or higher dividends can be reinvested to further increase the power of compounding. Regardless of how the dividends are used, companies with track records of delivering strong dividend growth over many years typically possess several enduring competitive advantages. After all, to consistently pay fast-growing dividends, a firm must be conservatively managed to survive the economy’s unpredictable cycles, generate a growing stream of cash flow over time and remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. However, the world is constantly changing, reshuffling the market’s winners and losers, as well as the best stocks to buy for future dividend growth. The 10 dividend stocks identified here have good if not downright impressive payout track records. Some have made uninterrupted payouts for over a century, and others have compounded their dividends by more than 20% annually over the last decade. However, they all have one thing in common: their dividends are either now frozen or expected to grow at a very slow pace over the next several years. A few of their dividends could even be at risk of a reduction, should conditions deteriorate further. Investors interested in strong and immediate dividend growth may want to avoid some of these companies, though a couple may bear watching until an eventual return to more meaningful dividend expansion. Data is as of April 6, 2018. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent quarterly payout and dividing by the share price.

Compass Minerals Market value: $2.1 billion

$2.1 billion Dividend yield: 4.6% Some companies are more dependent on factors outside of their control than others, which can result in less predictable earnings and dividend growth. Despite increasing its dividend for 14 consecutive years, including 8% annualized dividend growth over the last decade, Compass Minerals (CMP, $62.40) has stumbled upon hard times and decided to freeze its current quarterly dividend. Compass Minerals generated 57% of its 2017 revenue from selling salt (mostly for highway deicing) and the remainder from specialty plant nutrition minerals used to improve the yield of various crops. The company’s salt business has been hurt by unseasonably mild winter conditions the last few years, however, which caused fiscal 2017 adjusted operating earnings to decline 12%. Meanwhile, the company has been aggressively pursuing growth projects to expand its production capacity and diversify its sensitivity to winter weather. As part of this plan, Compass Minerals agreed to acquire the remaining 65% of Brazilian specialty plant nutrition firm Produquímica for nearly $500 million in 2016. The company’s balance sheet was stretched to finance these investments, and the North American agriculture business came under pressure as specialty fertilizer prices slumped. CMP’s payout ratio spiked above 100% in 2017, putting even more pressure on the company’s ability to deleverage as it deals with volatile weather patterns and crop prices. Needless to say, management’s decision to freeze the current dividend appears prudent, and investors shouldn’t expect much in the way of dividend growth for at least the next year or two.

Wells Fargo Market value: $258.3 billion

$258.3 billion Dividend yield: 3.0%

3.0% Wells Fargo (WFC, $52.23) can’t seem to catch a break these days. While the bank had long been known for its conservatism and reputation for avoiding many of the scandals that tarnished its rivals, everything changed in the third quarter of 2016. Specifically, it was brought to light that the bank had illegally opened millions of accounts that were not authorized by customers. CEO John Stumpf resigned and was replaced by COO Tim Sloan, the bank was fined a couple hundred million dollars, and Wells Fargo incurred several billion dollars of legal expenses in 2017. The bank has since ended its cross-selling quota system, which could reduce its long-term growth rate, and the Federal Reserve, which regulates U.S. banks, took unprecedented action to punish Wells Fargo further. In February 2018, the Fed announced that WFC must replace four of its board members by the end of the year and would be restricted from growing any larger than its total asset size as of the end of 2017 until it makes sufficient improvements to its business practices. The good news is that the Fed’s actions are not expected to affect the bank’s financial condition, and Wells Fargo’s dividend appears to remain safe. However, Wells Fargo’s payout ratio was 38% in 2017, which is meaningfully higher than the payouts of major rivals such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). When combined with the bank’s near-term growth challenges and regulatory scrutiny, income investors are unlikely to see much, if any, dividend growth over the new few years.

CVS Health Market value: $64.4 billion

$64.4 billion Dividend yield: 3.2%

3.2% CVS Health (CVS, $63.38) delivered 25% annual dividend growth over the last five years and has raised its payout each year for more than a decade. But despite its impressive track record, CVS has decided to keep its dividend flat for the time being. The healthcare industry is undergoing a number of meaningful changes, which are causing firms across the sector to adapt in many different ways. CVS is no exception. Vishnu Lekraj, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, writes, “CVS Health has sought a strategy of expanding beyond its legacy retail pharmacy operations and become a healthcare services company.” As the second largest pharmacy chain in the country and one of the biggest pharmacy benefits managers (PBM), CVS was already a major player in the healthcare ecosystem. However, as the medical sector focuses on becoming more efficient, management decided to make a bold move, announcing in 2017 it planned to acquire Aetna (AET), a health insurance company, for $77 billion including debt assumption. Should regulators approve the deal, CVS’s PBM business and drugstores would benefit from gaining Aetna’s insured customers. The company also has ambitions to provide various medical services for patients directly in its store locations. The hefty price tag to acquire Aetna will cause CVS’s leverage ratios to spike, however. Management wants to deleverage quickly while continuing to invest in its stores. Until the company’s balance sheet is restored, the dividend will remain frozen. MORE FROM SIMPLY SAFE DIVIDENDS: Best High Dividend Stocks in April

Sherwin-Williams Market value: $37.0 billion

$37.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.9% In business since 1866, Sherwin-Williams (SHW, $385.71) has managed to raise its dividend each year since 1979 and is a member of the venerable Dividend Aristocrats group of stocks. The company’s expertise is coatings. Through a network of over 4,000 company-operated retail stores, Sherwin-Williams provides paints and finishes to architectural and industrial contractors, as well as do-it-yourself homeowners. The firm also sells automotive finishes, protective coatings for boats, packaging coatings and more to various types of businesses. The company has thrived over the years by offering a high-quality selection of paints in convenient locations around the country, making it a go-to destination for many contractors. And as the business expanded, Sherwin-Williams rewarded shareholders with very strong payout growth. In fact, the company’s dividend grew at an annualized rate of 11% over the last 20 years. However, the pace of dividend growth slowed to 1% in 2017, and Sherwin-Williams announced another paltry 1% raise in February 2018. Instead, the company is using as much cash as it can to restore its balance sheet after acquiring rival Valspar for approximately $11 billion in 2017. Valspar increases Sherwin-Williams’ distribution network in international markets, brings new coatings technologies and provides opportunity for the combined company to realize meaningful cost synergies. Fortunately, substantial dividend growth likely will return within the next two years. Management projects the dividend will increase from $3.44 per share in 2018 to between $5.20 and $5.82 in 2020. Dividend growth investors just have to stay patient.

Gap Market value: $11.9 billion

$11.9 billion Dividend yield: 3.0%

3.0% Gap (GPS, $30.84) owns about 3,200 stores under brands such as Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta. As more shopping has moved online and competition from fast-fashion retailers like H&M has increased, Gap has rationalized its store count by more than 650 stores since 2005. Apparel retail has notoriously been a tough industry to invest in due to the fickle fashion tastes of consumers. More recently, the unrelenting ascent of e-commerce has pressured a number of brick-and-mortar retailers as they struggle to adapt to an increasingly digital world. Argus analysts John Eade and Marisa Janeczek wrote that while the company’s latest earnings results beat expectations, Gap “intends to close up to 200 Gap and Banana Republic stores, reflecting declining traffic at mall-based locations.” On a positive note, Gap plans to open around 270 Athleta and Old Navy locations over the next three years. These concepts earn higher margins and have stronger potential for omni-channel growth. Gap had paid stable or higher dividends for 15 years and recorded 13% annualized payout growth over the past half-decade, but management then froze the dividend in early 2015. The company recently lifted its quarterly payout by a penny, representing about a 4% raise to return to some sort of growth, but investors are unlikely to see a return to double-digit dividend expansion anytime soon. Gap simply needs to continue repositioning its store portfolio and diverting cash to its e-commerce businesses to remain relevant.

Omega Healthcare Market value: $5.3 billion

$5.3 billion Dividend yield: 9.7% Some parts of the healthcare sector are murkier and more complex than others, especially as the government seeks to create a more efficient system. Unfortunately, Omega Healthcare’s (OHI, $26.59) business finds itself in the middle of several uncomfortable challenges. After rewarding shareholders with dividend hikes each year since 2003, including more than 20 consecutive increases to its quarterly dividend most recently, the healthcare REIT announced its payout would remain frozen in 2018 as it works through a number of difficulties. Omega Healthcare’s core business rents skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to 74 operators in the U.S. and U.K. Its tenants primarily receive revenues through government reimbursements of Medicare and Medicaid. As a result, the company is largely at the mercy of federal policies surrounding healthcare funding. Changes in payment models, scrutiny of billing practices, cost inflation, and excess industry capacity have combined to pressure the industry’s rent coverage ratios in recent years. Omega Healthcare has not been immune as several of its tenants are struggling to pay their rent on a timely basis. As a result, the company is evaluating disposing of more than $300 million of assets this year to reduce its exposure to troubled tenants, and management expects 2018 adjusted funds from operations per share to decline about 9% from 2017. While Omega Healthcare’s dividend yield looks attractive, even without expectations for dividend growth this year, it’s not out of the question that the REIT’s payout could run into trouble over the next couple of years if industry headwinds intensify.

General Mills Market value: $25.8 billion

$25.8 billion Dividend yield: 4.3%

4.3% General Mills (GIS, $44.98) sells a diversified mix of packaged meals, snacks, cereal, yogurt, baking products and more under several well-known brands, including Cheerios, Yoplait, Pillsbury, Nature Valley and Betty Crocker. With a track record of paying uninterrupted dividends for more than 115 years, General Mills has long been a favorite holding in conservative income investors’ portfolios. Besides the company’s dependable payout shareholders have also enjoyed healthy dividend growth, including 9% annualized dividend increases over the past five years. Unfortunately, dividend growth is unlikely to resume for at least the next year, if not longer. Despite the company’s strong market share positions in core food categories Morningstar equity analyst Sonia Vora thinks the company’s “exposure to the center store, which has faced declining traffic the past several years as consumers increasingly shop for fresher alternatives in the perimeter, has pressured its brand intangible assets.” The company has struggled to achieve meaningful organic sales growth in recent years as consumers’ increasing preference for fresher, healthier foods has pressured several of General Mills’ core product categories. To help accelerate growth, in February 2018 the company announced plans to acquire natural pet food company Blue Buffalo for $8 billion. This deal significantly increases General Mills’ leverage ratios, so the company is very focused on restoring its balance sheet to maintain its credit rating. As a result, management suspended its current share buyback program and announced plans to maintain, rather than grow, its quarterly dividend. When combined with the headwinds General Mills faces in the center of the grocery store, shareholders shouldn’t expect any meaningful income growth for a while.

L Brands Market value: $10.7 billion

$10.7 billion Dividend yield: 6.3% Mall retailers have had a tough go in recent years, driven largely by changing consumer preferences favoring online shopping. L Brands (LB, $38.20) which owns more than 1,200 Victoria’s Secret and over 1,600 Bath & Body Works stores, had actually been performing relatively well until late 2016. The specialty apparel retailer saw its same-store sales growth drop to 0% during its fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, then plunge 9% in the first quarter of 2017, driven by a slump at Victoria’s Secret. Fiscal 2017 same-store sales ultimately fell 3%, with Victoria’s Secret down 8%. With earnings slipping and management having aggressively raised the dividend by 19% annually over the last five years, L Brands’ payout ratio hit 75% last fiscal year. As a result, management has decided to keep L Brands’ dividend payment frozen since June 2016 to preserve the company’s financial flexibility as it looks to rejuvenate top line growth. However, with mall traffic generally under pressure and competition only growing in the affordable lingerie category, L Brands certainly has its work cut out for it. Should conditions deteriorate further, the company’s track record of paying uninterrupted dividends for more than 25 years could even be jeopardized.

Helmerich & Payne Market value: $7.2 billion

$7.2 billion Dividend yield: 4.3%

4.3% Helmerich & Payne (HP, $65.45) specializes in contract drilling of wells for oil and gas exploration and production companies. While the company arguably has some of the best technology in the industry, part of the challenge in this sector is dealing with the unpredictable swings in energy prices. When oil and gas prices are high, producers have greater incentive to drill and utilize Hemerich & Payne’s equipment. However, with the price of WTI crude oil remaining more than 30% below its 2014 peak, conditions have been challenging to say the least. Per Baker Hughes, the number of North American oil rigs has dropped from 1,609 in October 2014 to 808 today, roughly a 50% reduction. Should the price of oil remain relatively low, weighing on rig utilization and day rates, Helmerich & Payne’s days of earning high margins could be over. Despite the company’s struggles to turn a profit, management has maintained a pristine balance sheet, which has allowed Helmerich & Payne to maintain its quarterly dividend. However, the payout has been frozen since the second half of 2016, and investors should not expect a return to robust payout growth anytime soon.","Like clockwork, a core appeal of dividend growth investing is receiving steadily higher payouts each and every year.

Xconomy San Francisco —

[Updated 12/5/18, 5:16 pm. See below.] The pharmacy industry’s transformation is accelerating, as traditional drug retailers strike deals to expand their businesses and fend off technology startups encroaching on their territory.

The latest salvo in the increasingly competitive sector is a $50 million investment in Alto Pharmacy, a San Francisco-based “digital pharmacy” startup that has offices in Denver. Like others in its industry, Alto offers online ordering and delivery (including same-day delivery) of prescription drugs.

Alto launched in 2015 under the name ScriptDash Pharmacy, initially offering a mobile app-enabled prescription delivery service in the San Francisco Bay Area. In conjunction with a $23 million venture investment it received last year, the startup changed its name to Alto Pharmacy and expanded its delivery service to the Los Angeles area. It also launched a software product to help doctors manage prescriptions and coordinate with patients’ insurance providers, TechCrunch reported.

Alto’s ambitions continue to grow with the $50 million Series C round announced Wednesday. The company plans to offer prescription delivery in more cities, and it’s introducing a mail-order prescription service for patients located outside of large metro areas, according to a press release. Alto also said it’s expanding the number of specialty drug therapies available through its platform.

Alto’s financing came from traditional venture firms: the investment was led by Zola Global and Greenoaks Capital, which were joined by Jackson Square Ventures, Olive Tree Capital, and other backers. But the funding follows a spurt of much larger deals involving pharmacy retailers that could shake up that industry.

CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), the Rhode Island-based retail pharmacy giant, closed its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna (NYSE: AET) last week, although there may be a hitch. On Tuesday, a federal judge reportedly raised questions about the transaction’s legality under antitrust rules, and he has yet to bless the U.S. Justice Department’s approval of the deal. Meanwhile, Cigna (NYSE: CI), a leading health insurer based in Bloomfield, CT, signed a $52 billion deal in March to acquire Express Scripts (NASDAQ: ESRX), the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits manager. Last month, the companies extended a deadline to close the deal from December 8 to June 8, 2019, although the businesses said they still expect the transaction to be finalized this year. The Justice Department approved the deal in September.

And then there’s Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which in June inked a deal to purchase PillPack, a New England-based online pharmacy startup. The deal opens the door for Amazon to sell prescription drugs, and is one of the clearest signs yet of the tech firm’s healthcare aspirations.

Alto and PillPack are part of a wave of startups rethinking the ways people access prescription medications. Other players include Boston-based ZappRx, which is trying to simplify the process of filling prescriptions for specialty treatments, like drugs for rare diseases. There’s also a host of startups offering prescription-delivery services, including Phil, Nimble Pharmacy, ScriptDrop, Zipdrug, and Capsule, which raised a $50 million funding round in August.

As the convenience of online ordering and home delivery services, led by e-commerce firms such as Amazon, is spreading to healthcare, traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies are following suit. CVS launched a next-day, nationwide medication-delivery service in June, and it has been rolling out same-day delivery in select cities. Walgreens also offers next-day prescription delivery, and it has been experimenting with same-day delivery at certain stores, including through a partnership with startup Deliv, which has offices in the Bay Area and Atlanta.

The startups and big companies are all vying for a piece of a huge market: Prescription drug sales are expected to exceed $800 billion worldwide this year, according to market research firm Evaluate Pharma. And when patients don’t correctly and consistently follow their treatment plans, it costs the U.S. healthcare system hundreds of billions of dollars each year, according to some estimates. This “non-adherence” to treatment plans can be the result of patients improperly using their medications because of circumstances like confusion or forgetfulness, said David Frankel, a managing partner with Founder Collective, which led the Boston-area venture firm’s investment in PillPack. [Added this paragraph and subsequent Frankel comments.—Eds.]

“That’s a huge opportunity for tech, whether it’s an app, device, or an end-to-end system like the one PillPack developed,” Frankel wrote in a statement e-mailed to Xconomy.

But the pharmaceutical industry “is a uniquely difficult market for startups to crack,” Frankel added.

“A big part of the reason PillPack succeeded, while many other consumer-focused pharma startups fail, is that [PillPack CEO and co-founder] TJ Parker is a second-generation pharmacist,” Frankel wrote. “The industry is so big, so complex, and so heavily regulated/subsidized that it’s almost impossible to succeed without an innate understanding of the players and their motivations.”

For its part, Alto says its software has helped clinicians and insurers save time on administrative tasks, and it claims its products and services have helped boost the rate at which patients stick to their treatment plans. Alto says its app makes prescription costs more transparent for patients, and they can also connect on demand with trained pharmacists employed by Alto, either through the app or on a phone call.

In markets where the company offers same-day prescription delivery services, orders are fulfilled at a nearby distribution center operated by Alto.

“Alto can cover the same geography as 400 chain pharmacy locations with one fulfillment center and same-day delivery,” CEO and co-founder Matt Gamache-Asselin claimed in a prepared statement. The $50 million investment “will allow Alto to reach more patients across the country and fill additional gaps in today’s pharmacy experience.”

Alto intends to add same-day prescription delivery service in Colorado and unspecified large cities on the East Coast, according to an e-mailed statement attributed to Gamache-Asselin. The company currently employs 200 people, and it’s hiring for roles in engineering, marketing, sales, and customer support, he added.

The $50 million investment was led by Zola Global and Greenoaks Capital, which were joined by Jackson Square Ventures, Olive Tree Capital, and other backers. To date, Alto has raised a total of $73 million in venture capital, according to the press release.","Alto Lands $50M as Pharmacy Sector Embraces E-Commerce LessonsXconomy San Francisco —[Updated 12/5/18, 5:16 pm.

The Nasdaq posted its seventh consecutive daily advance, while the Dow was down marginally. The S&P 500’s dip occurred as the index has inched closer in recent days to its record high set on Jan. 26.

“We had in January the fastest 10 percent decline from an all-time high in history,” said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling in Austin, Texas. “When you have substantial declines, particularly off of previous highs, you normally will see periods of digestion.”

China introduced new 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of goods imported from the United States in the latest tit-for-tat in the escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.

“This is going to continue at least until the midterm elections” in November, Phipps said. “Why would (China) negotiate with the U.S. now when they may get a mixed government to negotiate with after November?”

73,"Aug 9, 2018",PR Newswire,Long-term Cigna Shareholder Glenview Capital Submits Open Letter to Shareholders in Support of Cigna / Express Scripts Transaction,"Our firm, Glenview Capital Management (""Glenview""), is a 10-year investor in Cigna (NYSE:CI), and we support the Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) transaction for the following reasons:

1. Together, Cigna and Express Scripts will save their customers billions of incremental dollars annually with better healthcare outcomes, consistent with the social mission of each entity.

Cigna projects an incremental $253 per member of annual medical cost savings, the vast majority of which will flow to customers and payors, for customers who use managed care and PBM services from the newly combined Cigna / Express Scripts, an estimate corroborated by other leading industry players.

per member of annual medical cost savings, the vast majority of which will flow to customers and payors, for customers who use managed care and PBM services from the newly combined Cigna / Express Scripts, an estimate corroborated by other leading industry players. Cigna projects total spend growth below CPI, which will mean a 1-2% reduction in spend for its members, totaling more than $5b annually in the coming years. For example, this could be achieved with $253 of annual medical cost savings across 20m lives, or 20% of the total base who may adopt the full suite of Cigna / Express Scripts capabilities.

2. Cigna's long-term growth prospects will be stronger with the deal, and its per-share financial results will also be approximately 15% higher both near and long-term.

3. Cigna is paying a cheap price for Express Scripts compared to its history and precedent PBM transactions, paying 13x forward earnings (excluding Anthem) or 11.5x fully synergized earnings – approximately 25% below precedent transactions on an EV/EBITDA basis and an even greater discount on a price / earnings basis.

4. Cigna has earned long term shareholders' trust based upon its 21%+ annual shareholder returns during Mr. Cordani's eight-year term as CEO and its industry-leading control of medical costs.

5. Sensationalist headlines and intentionally misleading assertions from those with conflicting interests and limited analysis should not carry more weight than balanced diligence.

Long-term healthcare services investors, including Glenview, have done well investing in companies who do good, such as Cigna. Contrary to the sensationalist rhetoric of those pushing personal agendas, PBMs combat drug price inflation and encourage better pharmaceutical adherence, improving patient outcomes. For this reason, nearly all major US corporations, including nine owned by Mr. Icahn and every one of the companies mentioned as a potential emerging competitor, use a PBM to reduce their pharmaceutical cost. In addition, the Trump Administration is pushing for more Medicare Part B drugs to be included in PBM-assisted Medicare Part D. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations have challenged the for-profit healthcare system to innovate to enhance quality while reducing the inflation rate and overall dollar spend within the US healthcare system. Through the merger with Express Scripts, Cigna's Management and Board have provided shareholders the opportunity to do exactly that, in a transaction that is additive to earnings and value per share for owners.

We welcome the debate and discussion raised by both supportive and dissenting analysts alike, and we strongly believe in the democratic principles of shared governance. We agree that shareholders should do their own work, proxy advisory services should delve into important governance and procedural issues, reporters and publishing analysts should ask critical questions and seek substantiation for claims and assertions, and Management and Board members all should be accountable to shareholders. Based upon our own analysis, which we further describe herein, we conclude the following:

a) Management and the Board have a strong track record worthy of respect for their views;

b) The proposed transaction is well valued, well financed and contains adequate margins of safety;

c) The strategic merit of vertical integration between managed care and pharmaceutical benefit management has been proven and widely adopted by others in the industry;

d) The financial rewards of the transaction are compelling; and

e) The opportunity to lower health care costs for current and future consumers is exceedingly large, strengthening Cigna's ability to grow and serve its clients for many years to come.

* * *

Glenview Capital Management, a hedge fund in its 18th year of operation, owns / controls an approximately $1.3 billion investment in Cigna / Express Scripts, split approximately evenly between the two companies. We have owned Cigna continuously since 2008. At the time of the deal announcement, we had no position in Express Scripts. Following the deal announcement, we both increased our investment in Cigna and purchased a significant stake in Express Scripts as a means to create ""new Cigna"" at a discount through the arbitrage spread.

A Look Back at Healthcare Services Overhangs Over the Years

We are well aware of the evolving regulatory and competitive landscape that both of the managed care and PBM industries face, and experienced healthcare services investors have become used to such initial confusion. Set forth below are just a few of the transitory concerns companies and owners have faced over the last two decades:

1. From 1998 through 2003, the PBM industry underwent enhanced regulatory, customer, activist and media scrutiny regarding its transparency and the methods by which it reduced overall drug spend. Notwithstanding such oversight, PBMs were the best performing sector in the S&P 500 in the decade of the 2000's, fueled by horizontal consolidation and strong earnings growth generated by promoting price negotiation, generic conversion, pharmaceutical adherence, and mail order adoption.

2. In 2004 and 2005, pharmaceutical wholesalers fell out of favor with the investment community on fears that a migration to a fee-for-service business model, as well as potential competition from global logistics players such as UPS, would negatively impact their business. Yet, for the subsequent decade, the wholesale distribution industry generated strong per share earnings and free cash flow growth driven by horizontal consolidation, scale purchasing, increasing capital efficiency and logical capital allocation.

3. In September 2006, all of pharmaceutical services fell out of favor as Walmart, with its over 100 million[1] customers and immense purchasing power, introduced the concept of $4 generics available in its stores, thus compressing the valuation multiples of drug retailers, distributors, and PBMs. Twelve years later, Walmart's share of pharmaceutical retail has been cut in half.[2]



4. In 2008 through 2010, health insurers fell out of favor with investors as political and social advocates, as well as other elements of the healthcare chain, blamed managed care for all that ailed the US healthcare system despite their profits being less than 0.5% of total medical spend. Eight years later, the industry, including Cigna, has enjoyed strong membership and profitability growth as it has served an increasing share of both private and government-run healthcare programs while curtailing costs and promoting superior outcomes.

5. In 2011-2012, Medicare Advantage plans came under pressure as investors feared government mandated price reductions would meaningfully reduce profit margins as reimbursement with traditional Medicare was equalized. Since then, shares of Humana, the leading pure play Medicare Advantage company, increased five-fold, while its membership has nearly doubled.

6. In late 2016, hospital stocks suffered double digit declines upon the election results that welcomed in the Trump Administration for fears that ""Repeal and Replace"" would pressure and eliminate both healthcare coverage for Americans as well as hospital profits. Eighteen months later, the industry is experiencing strong admissions and fair reimbursement that continue to power patient outcomes and earnings growth.

Pharmaceutical Inflation and the PBM Debate – Negotiation LOWERS Drug Prices

During the past four Presidential Administrations, much attention and focus has been paid to the price of pharmaceuticals and the complexity of navigating the market. President and First Lady Clinton shined a light on the subject in the 1990s; in the Bush Administration, we saw Medicare Part D rolled out to provide seniors with insurance coverage for pharmaceuticals; in the Obama Administration, we saw several pilots to establish additional pathways for competition and innovation; and in the Trump Administration, senior officials are focused on driving down list prices and closing the gap between US and global pharmaceutical prices. Driven by the increasing mix of biologics and specialty drugs, along with the increased negotiating efficacy of PBMs, the gap between list price inflation and net price inflation has grown ever wider in the past five years, keeping drug costs within reach for American families.

According to IQVIA, both net prices paid and pharmaceutical co-pay inflation have been well controlled in recent years and are projected to continue as such. Despite the media focus on drug prices, estimated price growth on high cost branded drugs has been 2-5% in recent years aided by PBMs' negotiating power. Absent the role PBMs played, branded drug prices would have risen at a much greater rate over the same time frame.[3]

Additionally, out-of-pocket costs to consumers are actually down over the past five years. As shown below, while branded prices have increased, out-of-pocket costs have been a) substantially lower and b) declining over time. This trend is the result of PBM tools such as formularies and automatic substitution of generics.

Unfortunately, several bad actors in the pharmaceutical manufacturing space used either product shortages or other gimmicks to push through usurious price increases, gouging consumers and burdening the healthcare system. While government officials, activists and advocates have done an effective job in identifying and scrutinizing such behavior, it is appropriate that the system remain vigilant to guard against another wave of bad faith by manufacturers. Notwithstanding, in the first six months of 2018, customers of Express Scripts experienced per member growth in pharmaceutical spending at about half the national inflation rate, only 1.1%[4], reflecting the value of competitive negotiation through PBMs.

In addition, the government has recognized the excess value driven through Medicare Part D, which uses PBMs, versus Medicare Part B, which presently does not. As described by CMS Administrator Seema Verma:

""The issues that we face are different in Part B and Part D. Let's start with Part B. Medicare pays Part B providers for drugs at an amount equal to the average price the drug sells for plus a six percent add-on fee. This payment structure creates a perverse incentive for manufacturers to set higher prices, and for providers to pick drugs that are more expensive. While this system may have made sense when it was designed, in today's world, with some therapies costing over a half a million dollars, adding 6% to the sales price doesn't make sense … Now to Part D, where the story is different. Part D is a market-based system. At a time when premiums are rising in virtually every form of health insurance, premiums for Part D plans have been stable in recent years and are actually lower this year than they were last year. In Part D, a group of negotiators works on behalf of Medicare, to get a good deal for our beneficiaries. Plans hire PBMs to manage their drug benefit and to negotiate with drug manufacturers."" – CMS Administrator Verma, remarks at the American Hospital Association Annual Membership Meeting, May 7, 2018. Emphasis added.

Finally, seniors who are in the ""donut hole"", or the uncovered portion of Medicare Part D, are charged proportional to List rather than Net prices. As such, these Americans are victimized by growing gross price increases pushed through by the manufacturers that are beyond the reach of PBMs. We applaud efforts by the Administration to attempt to collapse such gross price increases provided that they don't eliminate the highly effective and functional negotiating incentives that PBMs have used to drive down insurance premiums and overall drug spend for seniors.

While it is true that both HHS Secretary, Alex Azar, and Pfizer CEO, Ian Read, have made comments that question the alignment of interests inherent in the rebate system, these comments need to be placed in context. Secretary Azar, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and CMS Administrator Verma have all recognized the vital contribution of the PBM industry in recent commentary:

""And so we have actually proposed giving me the authority to move drugs from Part B into Part D where the PBMs can negotiate on our behalf to secure -- to secure the kind of great deals -- the best -- we get the best deals of any payer in the commercial marketplace right now in Part D because the PBMs negotiate that for us."" – HHS Secretary Azar testimony at the House Energy & Commerce Health Care Subcommittee hearing, February 15, 2018.

""I think that we need to do everything that we can do to make drugs more affordable for seniors and I'm thankful that we have PBMs and the Part D program that are performing that negotiation on the behalf of seniors"" – CMS Administrator Verma at her Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing, February 16, 2017.

""Part D is a market-based system – prescription drug plans compete for beneficiaries … At a time when premiums are rising in virtually every form of health insurance, premiums for Part D plans have been stable in recent years and are actually lower this year than they were last year."" – CMS Administrator Verma remarks at the American Hospital Association Annual Membership Meeting, May 7, 2018.

""PBMs have done important work in negotiating rebates that go toward reducing premiums – growth in rebates is a major reason that Part D premiums have remained flat in recent years"" – CMS Administrator Verma remarks at the American Hospital Association Annual Membership Meeting, May 7, 2018.

""More broadly, the President has called on us to merge Medicare Part B into Part D, where negotiation has been so successful on so many drugs. This is how we follow through on his promise to do smart bidding and tough negotiating for our seniors."" – HHS Secretary Azar remarks on Drug Pricing Blueprint, May 14, 2018.

""Generic substitution is just one of those success stories. The buying power of large PBMs and formulary design is one reason that 81% of all small molecules drugs are available in generic formulations, and prices can fall by up to 80-90% after FDA approves multiple generic competitors."" – FDA Commissioner Gottlieb remarks in his 'Capturing the Benefits of Competition for Patients' speech at America's Health Insurance Plans' (AHIP) National Health Policy Conference, March 7, 2018.

Further, prior Administration and government officials have similarly spoken to the good work of the PBMs:

""… [the PBMs] are the ones who have driven down prices. So Part D has been flat, price-wise, for almost ten years, it's worked well, it's driven prices down."" – Former CMS Administrator Tom Scully remarks in CNBC interview, January 31, 2017.

""… PBMs compete to achieve lower costs, promote use of generics, use formularies to promote more affordable brand options … This—the power of effective private sector negotiation and competition—is why the Medicare prescription drug plan has come in at less than half of its original projected cost."" – Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Forbes Magazine, November 29, 2016.

""Hypothetically, if full transparency of all rebates were implemented nationwide … manufacturers would probably reduce their largest rebates because of the pressure that disclosure of such large rebates would place on their arrangements with other customers"" – Former CBO Director Peter Orszag in CBO letter to the Chairman & Ranking Members of four Congressional committees, March 12, 2007.

We also note that Pfizer attempted to push through its second set of 2018 price increases in early July and then was convinced by the Trump Administration to put such price increases on hold. Notwithstanding, for 2019, Pfizer saw Xyntha, Embeda and Viagra excluded from Express Scripts' formulary in favor of clinically effective, lower-cost alternatives because Pfizer failed to offer adequately low prices to Express Scripts' customers. We believe that Pfizer's commentary is best described as strategic misdirection.

Much discussion has centered around the ""elimination of rebates"" in the system. We understand the theoretical argument that if gross prices escalate and PBMs maintain a constant share of rebate dollars, then everyone appears to benefit from an inflationary environment. However, a highly competitive PBM industry has behaved differently. Higher gross prices and higher rebate dollars have led to lower percent rebate retention by the industry, as sophisticated clients and the myriad of consultants and advisors who represent them in contract negotiation have become an adept check and balance. Over the last 15 years rebate retention in the industry has fallen from greater than 50% in 2003 to approximately a low-to-mid-single-digit percent today. As disclosed by Cigna, rebates account for only 7% of Express Scripts' core EBITDA. Said differently and for the sake of argument, assuming all rebates went away and ESRX could not find any alternative means for reimbursement from clients, the acquisition P/E would increase to 14.0x stated and 12.4x synergized earnings per share, still well below comparable transactions.

While competition caps PBM pricing and profitability, know-how and capability also places a floor under it, and PBMs are functionally indifferent between rebates, point-of-sale discounts or other negotiated price breaks that carry with them administrative or success fees. In point of fact, 100% of rebates collected in government programs are entirely passed through to the government already, and Express Scripts' Tricare contract is done on a simple administrative fee, demonstrating the flexibility PBMs offer today.

We offer these observations to support the following conclusions:

a) The noise in the PBM industry is not unique, nor existential. Prior episodes of regulatory scrutiny have favored those businesses that do well for consumers and society. This time is not different;

b) The PBM industry has demonstrated an ability to lower drug costs and improve accessibility for American families;

c) The capabilities to adapt the business model have been repeatedly demonstrated by the industry as a whole and Express Scripts in particular; and

d) By pattern and practice, the government is using private negotiating partners such as PBMs more to get a better deal:

a. Medicare Advantage penetration has grown from 13% to 33% from 2005 to 2017.[5]

b. Managed Medicaid penetration has increased from 63% to 81% from 2005 to 2016.[6]

c. Medicare Part D enrollment has expanded from 22m to 43m from 2006 to 2018.[7]

The Value of Independent Analysis

As analysts, we all are challenged to sort through the myriad of assertions and pick out the truth from the misleading, and to resist succumbing to information that is incorrect but repeated so often that we assume it must be true. While we have great respect for Mr. Icahn, we believe that analysts who are feeding him information and insight to encourage him to lead the fight against this deal and the PBM industry may be arming him with information that is less than correct. We offer some simple corrections and context as examples for the consideration of our fellow Cigna shareholders:

1. On Fox Business yesterday, Mr. Icahn said ""They [Cigna] should have done that deal with Anthem, they could have fought the Government and they could have got that thing accomplished."" Cigna and Anthem did fight the Government, and lost in court.

2. In his initial letter, Mr. Icahn said ""Additionally, Express will go from being the 2nd largest PBM by number of scripts to the 4th largest"" once the Anthem prescriptions are removed in 2020. This is simply incorrect – pro forma for the loss of Anthem, they remain #2.

3. In a letter this morning, Mr. Icahn says ""According to a report published by Ross Muken and Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI, Express Scripts likely earns close to $1.1 billion of EBITDA from rebates or $850 million ex-Anthem. This is more than 15% of their total ex-Anthem EBITDA."" Mr. Icahn chose to ignore a corrective note issued by Mr. Muken only six hours later that said, based upon his review of an 8-K filed by Cigna, ""Express Scripts retains approximately $400M of rebates…far less than the roughly $850M we had estimated in a prior note this morning.""

This correction was published yesterday at 6pm , with plenty of time for Mr. Icahn to remove the misleading information from his letter this morning.

, with plenty of time for Mr. Icahn to remove the misleading information from his letter this morning. We applaud Mr. Muken for publishing this correction – while we have found much of his analysis to rely on significant conjecture, we appreciate this effort to correct the record when possible.

4. Mr. Icahn repeatedly cites Pfizer CEO Ian Read's comments about PBM rebates as demonstrating that PBMs somehow raise drug prices to consumers. A broader review of Pfizer's disclosures recognize that PBMs and tools they employ in fact reduce cost and encourage the use of the lowest cost medically equivalent alternative, including the following quotes from Pfizer's 2017 Form 10K:

""[PBMs] increasingly employ formularies to control costs.""

""[PBMs] also use clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available""

""…biopharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers, who continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives""

5. Mr. Icahn cites that as a long-time trustee at Mount Sinai Medical Center, including his generous support of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, he has seen first-hand the significant problem of prescription drug pricing in America. We note that high drug prices in a hospital setting he may have witnessed are most likely because of the absence of PBM access and tools in Mount Sinai, where new prescriptions administered on site are paid for through either Medicare Part B, which does not partner with PBMs, or through a commercial billing arrangement, which is largely prevented from accessing PBM discounts (as described by CMS Administrator Verma in quotes we included earlier). The place Mr. Icahn could see PBMs value first-hand would be in the nine companies he controls, where the experts he employs all renewed with Express Scripts within the past year.

6. Mr. Icahn asks index funds to vote against the deal because BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, in a 2018 letter to CEOs laudably reminded our industry that companies must benefit the communities in which they operate. Cigna's public disclosure indicates that the acquisition will enable them to reduce medical trend to below CPI, which implies an incremental $5-10 billion of annual savings to Cigna customers and the payors responsible for their healthcare (1-2% on $500 billion of aggregate spend). We believe that Cigna shareholders, including Mr. Icahn, would be hard pressed to explain how saving customers and payors so much money is harmful to society and the communities they serve, and that perhaps Mr. Icahn has been misled by misinformation fed to him by analysts with short-term personal agendas.

Valuation and Financing Provide a Margin of Safety

Throughout our time as Cigna shareholders, we have found Management and the Board to be disciplined capital allocators. Consistent with this approach, the negotiated price for Express Scripts appears highly attractive on a historical basis:

a) Cigna is paying 13x ""core earnings"" (excluding Anthem earnings that are going away in 2020) and 11.5x ""synergized earnings,"" which are core earnings including $600 million of synergies. This compares favorably to other transactions on both a P/E and EV/EBITDA basis.



ESRX Multiple Paid 2019



EPS Adjustments

Consensus EPS[8] $10.22 Less: EPS from Anthem[9] ($3.19) EPS Adjusted for Anthem $7.03



Purchase Price Adjustments

Value of Bid $96 Less: Cash from Anthem[10] ($5) Less: Capitalized Synergies[11] ($11) Core Purchase Price $81 Less: Added Capitalized Synergies per ESRX ($16) Adjusted Core Purchase Price $65



Core P/E including CI Synergies 11.5x Core P/E including ESRX Synergies 9.2x

b) Cigna is financing the acquisition with 51% cash and 49% stock, maintaining investment grade ratings with a well-termed debt structure and a clear path to delever to 40% debt-to-cap or below two years after the transaction's close. We believe they will reach 32% debt-to-cap in this timeframe, leaving them $6-7b of firepower for share repurchase or even greater fire power for accretive M&A.

c) From 2008 to 2018, Express Scripts on average traded at 14x EPS and 9.2x EBITDA.[12] Clearly the private market value being paid for the Company reflects a reasonable contingency for any degradation in economics due to incremental regulation or competitive intensity. Moreover, we believe that the P/E multiple for ESRX backing out Anthem on average has been 16x over the past five years and 18x over the past 10 years, magnifying the discount of its current valuation.

d) Tax reform increased Express Scripts' after-tax earnings and equity value by 21% as a result of higher retained earnings under the new tax regime. We believe attempts to characterize the premium paid to ""pre-affected"" stock price fails to recognize this exogenous event that drove the fundamental value of ESRX higher. The premium offered of 31%[13] is in line with prior deals, but it is less relevant to us, as the value of a company is its chain weighted discounted cash flows, not an arbitrary premium on a volatile trading value.

e) Mr. Icahn references the value destruction in the AOL / Time Warner transaction as a reason to vote against this deal. At the time of that merger, AOL was trading for over 200x[14] forward earnings, a far cry from 13x / 11.5x standalone / synergized earnings per share. While no price is low enough for a strategically poor deal, we believe that the acquisition multiples provide adequate cushion for unexpected fundamental headwinds.

Cigna Management and Board Have Earned Our Trust

Under Mr. Cordani's leadership, Cigna has thrived:

a) Since taking the helm in 2009, CI's overall medical membership has grown from 11 million to 16 million, and the Company has expanded into key growth areas like Medicare Advantage while avoiding industry pitfalls such as rushing into Public Exchanges.

b) Cigna has achieved the lowest medical trend of major Managed Care Organizations over the last eight years. Cigna expects this performance to continue in 2018.[15]

c) During Mr. Cordani's tenure, shareholders have enjoyed a 21%+ annual return, outpacing relevant indices and benchmarks.[16]

d) We believe Cigna's Board has demonstrated responsible risk management. Under Mr. Cordani's leadership, Cigna exited the Variable Annuity Defined Benefit business and associated liabilities (the ""VADB"" liabilities) that effectively exposed Cigna to significant risk in an equity market downturn. This stands in stark contrast to the continuous ownership and losses of GE Capital, the finance arm retained by GE, which was also referenced by Mr. Icahn as a reason not to pursue this deal.

e) Management and the Board entered into an agreement with Anthem to sell the Company, which was subsequently blocked by the Department of Justice on anti-trust grounds. While it has been suggested that Mr. Cordani would have preferred to remain CEO of an independent entity, he and the Board put shareholders first by agreeing to sell to Anthem, and thus, have reinforced their alignment with owners.

f) Shareholders recognized the Board's stewardships with a 96% vote for the re-election of directors at the last annual meeting and a 98%[17] vote for the re-election of Mr. Cordani, almost two months after the announcement of the Express Scripts transaction.

Plan B – Voting Down the Deal – Appears to be Backward Looking and Brings Additional Risk

Our firm has been a steadfast advocate of share repurchase as a tool to create shareholder value in growing, undervalued companies that are strategically complete. In addition, we do support measured, bolt-on acquisitions that are digestible, well-diligenced and appropriately financed if they offer superior risk-adjusted returns. Thus, in general, strategies such as those Mr. Icahn and external analysts he references hold some attraction. However, in this specific circumstance, a share repurchase and PBM partnership strategy seems inferior:

a) If shareholders fail to approve the deal, Cigna will have failed to integrate both horizontally (anti-trust) and vertically (lack of confidence from shareholders). Given Management's strong contention about the need for integrated scale capabilities to continue to lead and innovate, Cigna will be rendered strategically incomplete without a clear path to closing the gap.

b) While some suggest that a ""no"" vote means a simple return to the status quo, we believe such logic misses the simple point that a ""no"" vote in this transaction is akin to a ""no confidence"" vote in Cigna Management and Board and could crystallize a potentially irreconcilable difference between a block of dissenting shareholders and this top tier Cigna management team. A ""no"" vote may prompt turnover in senior management or the Board leading the Company to deviate from its strong historical path.

c) Strategically, ESRX is the best asset to position CI for the evolving, vertically integrating health care supply chain. Other PBMs are captive, subscale, or both. In the managed care and PBM space, JVs and strategic alliances have been tried by multiple players and have proven to be incapable of capturing full value for consumers and shareholders. The industry has shown that fully integrated ownership is more efficient and effective in driving economics and outcomes for sponsors and patients.

a. In one example, 40% of diabetics have behavioral co-morbidities. Those patients tend to spend 30% more on medical care. By integrating pharmacy, medical, and behavioral benefits, Cigna would be able to identify diabetic patients and provide medical and behavioral health support to lower medical expenses. This sort of care coordination is far more difficult to achieve effectively - or with the necessary speed to drive optimal outcomes - unless the PBM and managed care plan are under common ownership

b. In 2013, Cigna outsourced its PBM to Catamaran, which was later acquired by UNH. Having operated this strategic alliance for five years, Cigna concluded that owning the PBM was the best way to achieve the benefits of integration. According to a Cigna study, when pharmacy and medical benefits are integrated, customers save $253[18] per member per year on medical expenses and members achieve better health outcomes. With ESRX, the pool of relevant patients and cost savings will expand, offering an integrated pharmacy and medical benefit, with the top-tier scale and leadership that ESRX brings on the pharmacy side.

c. UNH and OptumRx are regarded as the first fully integrated medical and pharmacy benefit manager and together, are a market leader. By combining the medical and pharmacy files, UNH can save its customers over $200[19] per year on medical expenses, or ~4%.

d. When AET and CVS merge, the combined entity expects to reduce medical expenses by $240[20] per member per year through integration. Importantly, AET and CVS had been operating in partnership for the past eight years. Based on the learnings of that experience, the companies decided that a business combination was the optimal path forward.

Proxy Advisory Services Have Illustrated the Benefits of Looking Past Short-Term Stock Reactions and Towards Underlying Strategic and Financial Rationale – to the Benefit of Investors

Mr. Icahn writes that Cigna's stock price has traded lower since before announcing the deal. While that is true, we do not believe that it provides any indication of the long term value creation of the deal. Further, we applaud shareholder advisory services like Glass Lewis and ISS for focusing on the fundamental merits of a transaction instead of this short-term and less meaningful indicator.

When Centene announced the acquisition of HealthNet in 2015, Centene shares traded down by 34%, underperforming the S&P 500 and the relevant healthcare index[21] by 29% and 23%, respectively. Despite this initial reaction, ISS and Glass Lewis correctly identified the long term fundamental benefits of the transaction, including strategic rationale and EPS accretion. After ISS and Glass Lewis recommended that shareholders vote for the deal, Centene shares outperformed benchmarks by over 90%, including a total shareholder return of 117% in the first two years following the vote.

Similarly, following the announcement of CVS's acquisition of AET, CVS shares traded down by 10%, underperforming the S&P 500 and the relevant healthcare index[22] by 19% and 21% respectively. Again, ISS and Glass Lewis were able to focus on the right fundamentals: EPS accretion and strong industrial logic, which mirrors that of the ESRX/CI transaction. We applaud ISS and Glass Lewis for taking into account the fundamental positives and risks to the transaction, including the current regulatory environment, and recommending the transaction.

* * *

Critics of the PBM industry and this acquisition have questioned to role and value of middlemen, characterizing them as an unnecessary, unwise and unfair tax on the system. We believe such arguments are incorrect, and short-sighted:

a) In order to procure consumer goods cheaper, Americans turn daily to stores like Costco, who for a fee, access cheap branded and generic food and dry goods on behalf of their members and deliver significant savings and value to their customers through their bulk purchasing power. They collect both a membership fee and a ""spread"" or gross margin on the goods that they sell, but clearly Costco customers are better off for the net savings they enjoy.

b) In order to procure travel services cheaper, Americans turn daily to on-line travel agencies such as Expedia, who aggregate demand for rooms and airline seats and through their bulk purchasing power deliver great deals to travelers that were otherwise inaccessible on their own. They earn proportional to the value they provide and the competitiveness of the OTA market – if they are earning too much for the value they provide, then consumers will switch OTAs.

c) In order to obtain raw materials and inventory efficiently, American corporations employ procurement departments or participate in GPOs, or group purchasing organizations, who use their collective heft to bid venders of functionally equal goods or services against one another in order to obtain the most efficient price. Surely firing the procurement department would save money the next day, but it would also be exceedingly costly to the system and the consumer over any reasonable period of time.

Each of these entities is value added, and each of them earns a return proportional to the value it brings to its consumers. They are not a tax on the system, they are a service to their consumers, containing costs and overseeing quality on behalf of their constituents. The value PBMs produce are so significant that client retention rates are in the high 90s, and they serve nearly all significant American corporations and health plans. While we could reduce the price of a car by eliminating airbags, it would certainly not be advisable. We believe PBMs are a vital tool for consumers and payers to negotiate fair rates for medications and to promote competition amongst vendors of functionally equivalent products.

In conclusion, we thank the Board and Management of Cigna for allowing us as shareholders the opportunity to do well while the Company is doing significant good for its customers and constituents. We believe that Cigna has well exceeded the ""burden of proof"" necessary to support a transaction of this magnitude, and we hope that the vast majority of Cigna shareholders will reach the same conclusion. Thank you for your time and consideration.

75,"Feb 13, 2018",MarketWatch,"When a health insurer rejects your claim, here’s how to fight back","A former Aetna US:AET employee said that doctors don’t review patient records at the major insurer when making decisions regarding claims — and that may not be an uncommon practice.

Jay Ken Iinuma, a doctor who served as Aetna’s medical director for Southern California between 2012 and 2015, said in a deposition under oath that he never reviewed patients’ files when deciding whether to approve covering the cost of care or not. That task, as CNN first reported, fell to nurses.

Don’t miss:What the CVS-Aetna deal means for you

“Patients should always be able to trust that a health plan’s internal decision to deny or limit coverage is guided by a highly-qualified company physician who has reviewed all relevant information in the medical record,” said American Medical Association president David Barbe.

Though nurses receive medical training, they may not have the knowledge to determine the effectiveness of a given therapy in treating a medical condition. And that could mean that a patient may have their claim rejected, even though it should have been approved.

How the Trump administration could make claims more complicated

Though uncommon, when claims are denied, consumers should ask who was responsible for making that decision, which is often an opaque process, said Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy at Families USA, a nonprofit consumer health advocacy organization.

Fighting back could get all the more difficult if the GOP’s health care plans come to fruition. In October, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to explore the sale of health insurance policies across state borders, among other things.

The GOP argues that such offerings could help to drive down health care costs for consumers. But Fishman warned that it could also cut off at the knees consumers’ ability to appeal a denied claim, because these products wouldn’t necessarily have the same degree of government oversight.

Soul-searching over insurance claims in California

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, meanwhile, has launched an investigation to determine whether this alleged practice at Aetna was widespread. Some say that it could be a nationwide problem within the insurance industry. “These issues come up all the time,” Fishman said.

In a statement, Aetna said that its medical directors do “review all necessary available medical information” when evaluating cases, adding that such reviews are “an integral part of their yearly review process.”

Behind the Rising Costs of Long-Term-Care Insurance

How many claims are denied by insurers?

Most medical claims are approved — though the exact figure varies from insurer to insurer.

Taxpayer funded Medicare denied 4.9% of claims, more than any other insurer, according to a 2013 report from the American Medical Association.

Anthem ANTM, +0.84% withheld approval from 2.6% of claims. Aetna, Humana HUM, +0.62% , and Cigna CI, +1.22% had a denial rate of less than 2%.

But this could change if the current administration continues to roll back Obamacare. Those figures are significantly lower than the era before the Affordable Care Act. In 2008, Aetna denied 6.8% of its claims, according to the AMA.

“To use an old analogy, markets tend to take the stairs up – but the elevator down,” NYSE MAC Desk’s Ronald Bohlert said in an email.

“[T]here was no primary culprit today, just a whole lot of individual catalysts that came to a head and ushered the crowd to the door,” Bohlert added. “Rising yields, recent selling pressure in the market, some early negative pre-announcements, lingering trade worries, caution ahead of the financials reporting earnings on Friday, the approaching year-end… the stage was set for a couple of tires to finally blowout.”

Yields on the 10-year Treasury note hovered at 3.193%, while the 30-year yield edged higher to 3.375%.

Something “very unusual”

Typically, when stock prices drop precipitously, money moves into the bond market sending yields lower.

“Despite the equity sell-off, there was no move into Treasuries to seek safety,” Bohlert noted. “That’s an interesting dynamic.”

In an email on Wednesday afternoon, Academy Securities’ Peter Tchir said that the S&P 500 falling more than 1.5% and long-term yields rising simultaneously was “very unusual.”

“This is only the 4th time since 1/1/2016 it occurred,” Tchir observed. “Most recently were 2/2 and 2/8 which book-ended the VIX ETN/ETF fiasco.”

Analysts weren’t able to identify a particular event that triggered Wednesday’s sell-off. But the rise in interest rates in recent days is certainly concerning.

Story continues

“Stock market declines hurt confidence and reduce spending,” Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi’s Chris Rupkey said in an email on Wednesday afternoon. “We don’t know who is to blame here, it’s a little like trying to find what or who is responsible for the dangerous hurricane in Florida today. But make no mistake about it, the stock market decline, triggered perhaps by rising bond yields, is just as dangerous.”

Wednesday’s stock selloff was exacerbated after “the high-flying stocks that have propped indices up all year long reversed course,” Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon and Netflix as two such examples. “Those kinds of stocks had really, really bad days. And that’s actually rather overdue and sort of what you would see in a normal correction,” he said.

Cox added that investors “trying to divine some type of recession activity or worse markets to come” may be off base. “It’s not that at all – this is a correction that needed to happen since those stocks had really gotten ahead of themselves,” he said.

Investors holding more diversified positions will likely benefit from the sell-off as money flows into areas of the market that had been more underrepresented this year, including utilities and staples, Cox said. “Those types of stocks have really not done well this year and should have done better. So as that rotation occurs, that’s what you’re going to see,” he said.

NEWS: Hurricane Michael strikes Florida

Hurricane Michael, upgraded to a Category 4 storm early Wednesday, has become the most powerful storm to hit the continental United States in decades. Wind speeds reached 155 miles per hour as the storm made landfall in Florida. Duke Energy warned earlier that Hurricane Michael could cause as many as 200,000 power outages in the company’s serviced area in the Florida panhandle, and Bloomberg reported that the storm is expected to cause $16 billion in damages.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement Wednesday that it is “closely monitoring the impact of Hurricane Michael” on capital markets and investors.

“The dedicated staff of the SEC is preparing to provide support for market participants as Hurricane Michael approaches the Gulf,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement. “While we assess the need to extend deadlines for filings and other regulatory requirements, work to help ensure access to securities accounts, and monitor for storm-related fraud, we encourage all of those in its path to pay close attention to directions from local officials before, during, and after the storm.”

STOCKS: CVS-Aetna deal wins DoJ approval, Sears slumps

CVS received preliminary approval from the Department of Justice Wednesday for a $69 billion merger with health insurance giant Aetna. The go-ahead hinged on the condition that Aetna sell off its Medicare Part D prescription drug business to appease regulators’ competition concerns about overlap between CVS’s and Aetna’s drug plan businesses. The merger is among the largest healthcare deal to gain antitrust approval from the Justice Department and follows Cigna’s recent $52 billion acquisition of Express Scripts Holding. Shares of CVS (CVS) were up nearly 1% to $80.22 at 11:42 a.m., while Aetna’s (AET) stock was up 1.34% to $206.45 per share.

Sears (SLHD) is said to be planning to file for bankruptcy as soon as this weekend in the wake of an approaching debt payment the struggling retailer may not be able to meet. Sears owner Eddie Lampert has pushed a debt restructuring plan that would help avoid a Chapter 11 filing, but is now focusing on a deal to maintain stakeholders’ value in a court restructuring, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Sears’s stock fell 16.83% to $0.49 per share at the end of trading Wednesday.

Tesla (TSLA) is said to be in the process of obtaining land in Shanghai for the electric car-maker’s first factory outside of the United States, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the plans. Tesla signed a deal with Chinese authorities in July to build a new auto plant in Shanghai, which CEO Elon Musk has said will eventually have the capacity to product 500,000 electric vehicles per year. Musk told analysts and investors during an earnings call in August that it would take about $2 billion of investment for the factory to produce around 250,000 vehicles a year.

Separately, James Murdoch, the outgoing CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox, is reportedly the lead candidate to replace Elon Musk as Tesla’s chairman, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter. Musk reached a settlement with the SEC requiring in part that he step down as chairman of Tesla for at least three years. The settlement came following a lawsuit the SEC filed against Musk alleging he had defraud investors with statements from August that he intended to bring Tesla private with “funding secured.” Shares of Tesla were down 2.25% to $256.88 each at market close Wednesday.

Canada’s cannabis stocks rose following reports that tobacco company Altria (MO) is in talks to acquire a stake in Aphria (APHQF). Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, is interested in a minority stake in Aphria with the potential of acquiring a majority stake over the longer term, the Globe and Mail first reported. Aphria’s stock rose 15.07% to $15.43 per share at the end of trading Wednesday.

Luxury stocks fell on concern that LVMH, which owns major fashion brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Marc Jacobs, may be losing customers in its key markets in China. About one-third of all LVMH revenue comes from Asia. The companies were further hit Wednesday after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the luxury-good sector to underweight from neutral, citing waning demand from Chinese consumers. Shares of LVMH (MC.PA) fell 7.14% to $265.30 each at market close Wednesday.

ECONOMY: Mortgage applications fall, producer prices inch higher

U.S. mortgage applications fell last week as home borrowing costs rose to their highest levels in more than seven years. The Market Composite index, which measures the volume of mortgage loan applications, fell 1.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending October 5, according to a release from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Lower demand for mortgage refinances hampered mortgage lending, with refinance volume down 3% last week.

Producer prices in the U.S. rose 0.2% in September, in line with average economist expectations based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The results, released Wednesday from the Labor Department, represent a turnaround from a 0.1% decline in August and mark the first increase in three months. The core measure excluding food and energy was also 0.2%, in line with expectations, while the alternative core measure excluding trade services, food and energy increased 0.4% month-over-month, exceeding average analyst expectations of a 0.2% rise.

“The trade services component, which measures margins for retailers and wholesalers, rose only 0.1%, after two sharp declines,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note Wednesday. “It remains well below the trend, which is rising, so we look for a big rebound in October.”

79,"Dec 24, 2017",The Motley Fool,3 Top Health Insurance Stocks to Buy,"The passage of the Affordable Care Act led to millions of Americans gaining health insurance through insurance exchanges, employers, and Medicaid, but the impact on insurers has been mixed, and potential reform could lead to unintended consequences for the industry.

In order to pick this industry's winners and losers, you need to understand how health insurers make their money, what metrics are useful in evaluating these companies, and what the pros and cons are for insurers targeting commercial and government health insurance markets.

First, some background

Regardless of whether a health insurer's business focuses on commercial, individual, or government markets, the goal of any insurer is to collect more in premiums than it spends on healthcare for its members.

Insurers manage their profitability by carefully considering markets and only participating in those that present a lower-than-average risk to them. In those markets, health insurers make assumptions about the health of their members and price their premiums accordingly. They also leverage their scale to negotiate lower prices from healthcare providers, such as doctors and hospitals, and drugmakers. Additionally, they may encourage behaviors that prevent disease or hospitalization, such as prescription drug adherence, smoking cessation, and gym memberships.

Generally, it may help to think of health insurers as middlemen that collect a percentage of profit from member premiums in return for managing members healthcare expenses. The percentage health insurers keep for their efforts varies, but operating margins are usually in the single-digit to low double-digit percentages. For example, the following table shows you operating margins over the past 12 months for some of the largest publicly traded health insurers. Typically, diversified insurers, such as UnitedHealth Group, enjoy higher operating margins than government health insurers, such as WellCare Health.

Insurer Market Focus TTM Operating Margin UnitedHealth Group NYSE:UNH) Diversified 7.33% Anthem NYSE:ANTM) Diversified 5.05% Aetna NYSE:AET) Diversified 5.95% Cigna NYSE:CI) Diversified 8.42% Humana NYSE:HUM) Government/Medicare 5.69% Centene NYSE:CNC) Government/Medicaid 3.24% WellCare Health NYSE:WCG) Government/Medicaid 3.43%

Because the industry's operating margins are small, scale is undeniably important. Large insurers -- all things equal -- can negotiate better prices on behalf of members, can charge more in premiums, and can collect more in interest on premiums that aren't spent on healthcare.

Evaluating health insurers' performance

Paying close attention to an insurer's ratio of healthcare costs to premiums collected is a good way to separate industry winners from losers. This ratio is called different things by different insurers, but it's often referred to as the medical loss ratio (MLR), medical cost ratio (MCR), or medical benefit ratio (MBR) in corporate filings and presentations.

Commercial insurers ratios are usually lower than community- and state-focused insurers, so it's important to only compare ratios between companies competing in the same marketplaces. Overall, a lower ratio is better than a higher ratio, and generally speaking, a ratio that's in the low 80%'s is good for diversified health insurers, such as UnitedHealth Group and Cigna, and a ratio in the high 80%'s is good for Medicaid insurers. Currently, UnitedHealth's and Cigna's ratios are among the lowest of major publicly traded insurers, clocking in at 80.2% and 81.4%%, respectively. In Medicaid, WellCare Health's 86.9% is better than Centene's 88%. Humana makes most of its money serving Medicare members and its 82.1% ratio is solid, too.

These ratios fluctuate from quarter to quarter, however, and business decisions, such as expansions into new markets, can increase them in the short term. Centene's ratio, for example, is higher in part because of it pushing deeper into the ACA exchanges. Alternatively, UnitedHealth Group's ratio is lower because it's no longer participating widely in the exchanges.

Since medical costs ratios fluctuate, investors should also consider other metrics, including net income growth. Insurers that successfully expand into new markets, acquire competitors, or price plans accurately will produce higher levels of net income growth than those that don't. In this next table, you can see which health insurers are delivering the best year-over-year net income growth rates as of Q3 2017. WellCare, Centene, and Aetna are among the standout performers on this measure.

Insurer Medical Loss Ratio Q3 Net Income Growth (YOY) UnitedHealth Group 81.40% 26.30% Anthem 86.10% 20.90% Aetna 81.90% 38.70% Cigna 80.20% 22.80% Humana 82.10% 10.90% Centene 88% 39.46% WellCare Health Medicare = 85.7% & Medicaid = 86.9% 150%

Impact of reform

Attempts at widespread health insurance reform fell flat in 2017, but the individual mandate got repealed in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Repealing the individual mandate could have important consequences for health insurers that derive a significant proportion of their business serving the individual health insurance market.

If repealing the individual mandate results in healthy Americans canceling their health insurance policies to avoid premiums, then membership pools could skew toward sicker patients, causing the medical cost ratio at these companies to climb. If that happens, then insurers like Centene and Anthem that have invested heavily in the ACA marketplaces could see their profitability fall more dramatically than their competitors.

Although Medicaid reform hasn't passed Congress, Republicans have proposed shifting Medicaid to a block grant program. If they succeed in doing that, then some states with more generous Medicaid programs may be forced to restructure their programs in ways that reduce Medicaid enrollment. Since Medicaid insurers are paid by states based on Medicaid enrollment, such a change to block grant funding could create revenue and profit headwinds.

Tax reform that increases employment also has an impact on the industry because many employers provide workers with employer-sponsored health insurance. If lower corporate tax rates translate lower unemployment rates, then revenue at insurers with exposure to the commercial market should increase.

3 insurers to buy

Given the pros and cons of reform, UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, and Humana are currently my favorite health insurance stocks to include in portfolios.

What's attractive about UnitedHealth Group is that it isn't very exposed to the repeal of the health insurance mandate. It's already exited most of the ACA exchanges, so individual membership from the ACA represents a small proportion of its business. Instead, it makes most of its money by selling employer-sponsored health insurance plans and Medicare plans. Those markets are likely to remain strong. Unemployment is only 4.1% and aging baby boomers are increasingly enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans that cap risks associated with unlimited coinsurance under Medicare Parts A and Part B.

UnitedHealth's operating margin is among the industry's best and its medical loss ratio is low thanks in part to the negotiating power associated with being the nation's biggest health insurer. The sheer size of UnitedHealth Group is also a plus in a rising interest rate environment because a lot of the company's unspent premiums are held in short-term investments that react more positively to rate increases. Furthermore, its Optum segment has become a leader in managing corporate pharmacy benefits and healthcare analytics. Because UnitedHealth insures so many people, it can offer better insight into healthcare trends, exploiting insights for its clients to use to reduce their costs. It also doesn't hurt that UnitedHealth's shares yield 1.3%, the highest yield within the large-cap health insurance industry.

Aetna is intriguing for a few reasons. First, it operates a large Medicare business that's benefiting from baby boomer demand. Second, it has broad exposure to the employer market. Third, pharmacy giant CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is attempting to acquire it for $207 per share.

Currently, Aetna's shares are trading below CVS Health's offering price because of fear that regulators will block their merger. That's possible, but there isn't a tremendous amount of overlap between these two companies. CVS Health does sell Medicare Part D plans under the SilverScript brand name, but it's a pharmacy retailer and pharmacy benefits manager first and foremost, not an insurer. If regulators approve the deal, then Aetna's shares will close the gap to CVS Health's offer price, but even if regulators block it, Aetna should do fine on its own.

Finally, I'm a fan of Humana's reliance on Medicare enrollment. Although it dabbles in other markets, it's the largest pure-play Medicare insurer investors can buy. If you believe (I do) that an increasingly larger number of seniors are going to live longer than ever before, then it's hard to dislike Humana's Medicare-heavy business model. I'm also intrigued by the company's recent decision to acquire parts of senior housing company Kindred Health (NYSE:KND). That deal could provide it with intriguing opportunities to better serve its members and control costs.

Something else to keep in mind

Washington, D.C.'s whims and whispers can make health insurers more volatile than other stocks, and dividend yields on health insurance stocks aren't as enticing yields for other insurers, such as property and casualty stocks or reinsurance stocks. Because there is a significant political risk and these stocks don't offer much in the way of income, an argument can be made that health insurers aren't the most attractive insurers to own. While that may be true, health insurers enjoy big demographic tailwinds to revenue and profit. It's also possible that health reform is done in a way that's more friendly to insurers' profitability. If that happens, then health insurance stocks could outperform other investment opportunities.","Typically, diversified insurers, such as UnitedHealth Group, enjoy higher operating margins than government health insurers, such as WellCare Health.

80,"Jun 23, 2020",Kiplinger,5 Dividend Stocks That Can Deliver Income AND Growth,"Finding growth stocks to invest in isn’t a very difficult task, even when a bull market is this long in the tooth. (Stocks are approaching the nine-year mark of its upward march without a decline of 20% or more.) However, investors seeking growth as well as reliable dividends – from the very same stock – could find the selection process a little more trying. What should you look for to ferret out these dividend stocks? Broadly speaking, you want companies with solid businesses whose products and services typically will be in demand year in and year out. You then want to make sure those companies are growing the top and bottom lines, and ideally analysts should expect that to continue. Revenue expansion is a simple indication that there’s still growth potential in a stock. But profits help prove long-term viability and fund the dividend. After that, you want to look for a few specifics: A dividend yield above the average of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index (currently 1.8%); consistent dividend growth, which helps protect against inflation; and a relatively low payout ratio (dividend per share divided by earnings per share), which indicates that a company can both afford the current dividend, and afford to improve it in the future. Many investors look for a payout ratio below 60%, while more conservative investors seek a payout below 50%. Here’s a look at five dividend stocks that meet these criteria. As a result, investors can expect them to deliver both income and growth in the foreseeable future. Data is as of Feb. 21, 2018. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent quarterly payout and dividing by the share price. Companies are listed alphabetically.

CVS Health Market value: $69.4 billion

$69.4 billion Dividend yield: 2.9%

2.9% CVS Health (CVS, $68.76) is the largest pharmacy operator in the U.S. and has increasingly turned its locations into small general stores. However, lesser-known is the fact that CVS also operates a large pharmacy benefits business that serves more than 1 million customers annually and profitably provides Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. CVS now is trying to add another arm onto its business. The pharmacy agreed to a $69 billion buyout deal with Aetna (AET) – the No. 3 health insurance provider in the U.S. – in late 2017. The belief is that CVS is trying to fend of Amazon.com (AMZN), which appears poised to challenge several health care industries via different initiatives. Analysts at Wells Fargo are hopeful, expecting the merger between Aetna and CVS to result in $750 million in annual revenue and cost benefits by year two. The company’s core pharmacy business tends to keep churning in good times and bad, which has helped keep profits steady enough to fund a dividend since 1993. Better still, that payout has increased every year since 2004, making it a Dividend Achiever.

Las Vegas Sands Market value: $57.7 billion

$57.7 billion Dividend yield: 3.9%

3.9% Las Vegas Sands (LVS, $75.06) is well-known for its casino operations here in the United States, but it also owns and operates casinos in Singapore and the Chinese province of Macau. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by a couple cents per share to 75 cents, or $3 annually, which comes to a yield of nearly 4% more than twice as nice as the S&P 500. That came alongside a September-quarter earnings report that saw profits grow 11% per share. More good news from that report? “Our (Macau) operations produced its best quarter since quarter four 2014 with adjusted EBITDA reaching $652 million.” Prospects in China look even better after a Feb. 1 report that showed Macau gaming revenue jump 36% year-over-year in January – its best such improvement in four years. That could mean LVS’ earnings could grow more than the 7% analysts currently expect for 2018. Meanwhile, analysts at Morgan Stanley say strong growth in Macau and Singapore could provide additional cash flow and provide a catalyst to increase the dividend further.

McDonald’s Market value: $128.1 billion

$128.1 billion Dividend yield: 2.4%

2.4% McDonald’s (MCD, $158.64), with more than 37,000 restaurants worldwide, is among the best-known fast-food chains on the planet. As such, it’s fairly saturated, and analysts even are projecting a single-digit decline in revenues for the current fiscal year. That said, McDonald’s still may be an opportunity for share gains and dividends. As the company shifts to an almost entirely franchised business model, it should enjoy the benefits of collecting lucrative franchise royalties and fees, which have few associated costs. That’s in large part why, even though McDonald’s simply doesn’t have much more room for expansion, analysts expect profits to grow more than 14% in 2018. McDonald’s is a Dividend Aristocrat that sports a modest current yield. However, its consistent dividend growth – MCD has paid out higher distributions each year for more than four decades – means yield on cost keeps getting better for anyone holding shares. The yield also is on the low side right now in part because of a 25% jump in shares over the past 12 months. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analysts suggest that McDonald’s shares “have appeal as a total-return (dividends + share appreciation) vehicle, including a long history of dividend increases.”

PepsiCo Market value: $155.9 billion

$155.9 billion Dividend yield: 2.9%

2.9% PepsiCo (PEP, $108.00) is a global food and beverage company whose well-known brands include the namesake Pepsi-Cola, as well as Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker and Tropicana. After a few years of declines in the top line, PepsiCo is back to growing revenues, and in fact, analysts expect sales to improve by low single digits for the next couple of years. Also, PepsiCo is a strong cash-flow generator, and it puts that cash flow to good use – once in a while in acquisitions such as 2016’s deal for KeVita, but also via raising its dividend and repurchasing shares. For the uninitiated: Share repurchases are a powerful catalyst for share appreciation because they take shares off the market and help juice the earnings-per-share number. In its fourth-quarter earnings report in February, PepsiCo announced a new $15 billion stock repurchase program spanning from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2021, that will replace an expiring $12 billion program dating back to July 1, 2015. PepsiCo also announced another increase to its dividend – the 46th consecutive such increase, which means it too is a Dividend Aristocrat. Right now, analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch believe shares’ current valuation fails to reflect management’s efforts to accelerate growth in PepsiCo’s core beverage business. Translation: There's more room for upside in shares.","Finding growth stocks to invest in isn’t a very difficult task, even when a bull market is this long in the tooth.

But only about half of Americans participate in an employer-sponsored retirement fund, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, and a much smaller 18.7% of Americans own stock directly. In both cases, market participation is skewed toward those with higher incomes, which means that the wealthy disproportionately benefit from Wall Street's boom.

Rising home prices aid the relatively wealthy

Home prices reached all-time highs, according to the Case-Shiller home price index. That's especially the case in hot markets like Seattle and San Francisco, where many working people are already unable to afford ownership.

Although homeownership is a source of middle class wealth, homeowners generally tend to be higher-income. According to the Census Bureau, 78.4% of families making more than the median income own homes, compared to 49.5% of those making less.

Profits are spiking, but wages still lackluster

After-tax corporate profits set new records in 2017, reaching $1.86 trillion in the third quarter.

At the same time, the share of the gross domestic product that goes toward wages remained near a recession-era low. That means workers are taking home less of the economic pie. To be sure, there were signs this year that wages are growing for people on the bottom of the pay scale. But over the past ten years they've grown faster for people at the top.

Meanwhile, mega mergers proceeded apace in 2017, furthering the trend of corporate consolidation that economists say allows monopolies to squeeze excess profits out of consumers. Some worry that the proposed union between CVS (CVS) and insurance giant Aetna (AET) could give the pair too much power to steer customers toward their own offerings, for example, and that chemical company Bayer's (BAYRY) acquisition of Monsanto (MON) could raise seed prices.

Fewer rules help the rich

The repeal of many Obama-era regulations by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans has been applauded by businesses, which say they will operate more efficiently and save money. It remains to be seen how much of such savings will flow down to workers and how much will go to investors.

In one of the more high-profile rollbacks in 2017, the administration overturned the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule against forcing consumers into arbitration proceedings. That was a win for financial companies, making it more difficult for people who've been wronged to seek redress.

The Justice Department decided in June to back away from a measure that expanded the number of workers eligible for overtime pay, likely reducing the amount of money companies need to spend on wages.

""These are all ways that are just allowing the top to garner higher incomes, and to push the costs on to the public,"" said Heather Boushey, director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning think tank.

A tax bill for the wealthy

While the just-passed Republican tax plan cuts taxes for most lower- and middle-income people, it is particularly generous to people with high incomes and big bank accounts.

The Tax Policy Center estimates that a new 20% tax deduction for pass-through income, a doubling of the estate tax exemption, lower ordinary income tax rates, and a more generous alternative minimum tax will send 65.3% of the bill's individual benefits to people in the top 20% of the income spectrum, with the top 1% getting a $50,000 tax cut on average in 2018. As the years go on, the value of tax breaks shifts further toward the top.

And hedge fund managers in large part kept their carried interest provision, which Trump had promised to eliminate.

82,"Nov 6, 2018",Equities.com,"Financial Myths: The Bigger They Come, The Harder They Fall","



The Myth Buster has been looking at the general reluctance of the federal government to go after monopolies. Newer areas such as the Internet and high technology make government oversight more difficult. The products and services are harder to understand. Laws written in previous generations may not apply directly to these towering technology giants. In addition, from the Myth Buster series on “The Falcon Cannot Hear the Falconer” (May/June/July 2018), most people see giant technology companies as beneficial and do not clamor for government protection.

For example, Microsoft ( MSFT ) holds a clear monopoly in office technology but they are allowed to grow in wealth and maintain control over this massive industry using software and operating systems that bear no real competition. Google ( GOOG ) grows unchecked. Facebook ( FB ) – the relative newcomer to the rich tech group – continues to grow despite its embarrassing revelations about data selling.



These giants are also acquiring tomorrow’s technology, especially artificial intelligence. This year alone, Microsoft acquired GitHub (private) for $7.5 billion. Salesforce ( CRM ) bought MuleSoft (private) for $6.5 billion. PayPal ( PYPL ) took over iZettle (private) for $2.2 billion. Today’s giants are already spawning tomorrow’s godzillas.

Mergers and acquisitions – a natural source of government intervention -- are blowing the roof off! In the first half of 2018, according to DealBook, $2.5 trillion of mergers and acquisitions were announced. International acquisitions apparently see no boundaries either, creating a seamless series of invisible business borders that some politicians would love. Few organizations operate only inside their own home country. For example, Comcast owns Telemundo, a Spanish-language broadcasting station. CVS, the familiar local drug store across the US, owns Drogaria Onofre, which was Brazil’s eighth-largest drugstore chain when purchased. Clearly, size matters and boundaries are shrinking.

Massive size generates a yawn from those in power. A court’s OK for AT&T’s (T) $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner (private) spurred the pace of recent blockbuster deals. Shortly after this gargantuan monetary arrangement, Comcast ( CMCSA ) bid $65 billion to acquire Fox (FOX/FOXA). The first plan fell away and the deal has shrunk to a mere $34 billion bid by Comcast for Sky, a large part of Fox.

The marriage ceremonies of giants have been well underway for the last two years. Consider these additional behemoth moves in the last year that might have kindled outrage. CVS (CVS) acquired insurance provider Aetna ( AET ) for $69 billion. The new conglomerate offers health insurance and CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts will morph into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. The tremendous growth of health insurance and drug provider firms makes clear that size matters. Massive revenue is one issue related to monopolies; control of a type of product or service is another. Pharmaceutical giants acquire similar companies to control a major area of medical care. In the cash-is-king end of medical care, for example, Roche ( RHHBY ) acquired medical software provider Flatiron Health (private) for $1.9 Billion. Impact Biomedicines (private), a cancer drug developer, was acquired by Celgene ( CELG ) for $1.2 billion.

Size is clearly an advantage. A level down in technology one finds service providers: television stations, telephone and Internet service companies and other broadcasters. The law and the public tend not to view organizations such as Verizon ( VZ ), Sprint ( S ), DirecTV and NBC (owned by Comcast) in the same halo-lit category as the high tech giants with the shiny market capitalization. When seen in the glare of older technology, their efforts to merge and acquire generate suspicion and trepidation. They look more like the old AT&T or Standard Oil. This is a strange pattern. Google’s market cap tops $800 billion; AT&T weighs in at $248 billion. But, Google gets away with grabbing the helmet -- to borrow a football phrase -- while smaller AT&T gets the half the distance to the goal penalty.

An interesting pattern seen in the case of the Justice Department’s effort to stop AT&T from acquiring Time Warner is the minimal notice taken by the public. The government acts aggressively while the court concurs with the building of massive conglomerates. Consumers take little notice. Consequently, the well-known myth title, “The Bigger They Come, The Harder They Fall” does not fit the contemporary business scene!

Consider what else is going on in the fast-moving, rapidly changing entertainment/Internet industry – itself a new industry that is hard to define. Disney ( DIS ) is acquiring many major assets of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that spans the 20th Century Fox film studio, Disney’s sizeable TV production wing, 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and a share of Star TV. Disney, which already owns ESPN, will also gain majority control of Hulu, the popular streaming service. The federal authorities leaped on the transaction, but as of late October, the courts are readying the rubber stamp for the birth of yet another giant. And consider how many sizeable separate industries – television, Internet, communication, movies, sports -- fall under this likely new corporate umbrella.

In the health care field – a massive industry under pressure to rein in costs – all mergers claim to reduce expense. Some staff may be combined when two giants join in wedlock. But, monopolies also imply that competition falls through the wide scale creation of conglomerates. Where is the outrage? Where is the evidence to support the dangers of conglomerates?

It seems that the bigger they come, despite control of massive revenue, multiple industries and wide territory, these already giant corporations about to merge or acquire do not fall at all. In fact, the more gently they float. Next month in a year end review, the Myth Buster will take a look at how well he has done uncovering the rattlesnakes and iguanas that lurk in so many business decisions.

As recently as the end of May, stock prognosticators were calling for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit 30,000. Some suggested the Dow would reach that number by the end of 2018. Growth looked in, and slow-but-steady value picks were out. That was until October’s bout of nauseating volatility. Thanks to a trade war with China, higher interest rates, problematic technology earnings and worries that a decade-long bull market is primed to lose its legs, the Nasdaq hit correction mode and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index came close. Growth stocks – especially smaller companies – have been hammered, while large-cap value stocks have gained favor among investors looking for a little protection to go with their upside potential. Here are 10 large value stocks to buy now, with the expectation that they should thrive compared to their growthy brethren in a tumultuous environment. Data is as of Nov. 5, 2018.

Berkshire Hathaway Market value: $539.8 billion

$539.8 billion Dividend yield: N/A

N/A Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E): 18.7

18.7 Analysts’ opinion: 4 buy, 0 overweight, 4 hold, 0 underweight, 0 sell A watershed moment came in July for Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $216.24) shareholders. The company’s board made a significant change to its share repurchase program that changes how CEO and founder Warren Buffett, along with vice chairman Charlie Munger, decide when to buy back shares. Before the July announcement, Berkshire Hathaway would pay no more than a 20% premium above its book value per share, making it almost impossible for the company to repurchase its shares. Now, if Buffett and Munger believe the repurchase price is significantly below its intrinsic value but above 1.2 times book value, the company can buy back its stock. In August, after the board revised the rules for buying back its stock, Warren Buffett said he purchased a little Berkshire Hathaway stock – likely at prices around 1.4 times book value, about 17% above the former price ceiling. “Today I believe is the first time that Buffett has ever disclosed that they have bought back any shares above 1.2 times book,” Whitney Tilson, the former head of Kase Capital, told CNBC. “And I think this is a major, material new piece of information.” We recently found out just how much Berkshire bought back: $928 million worth. Prices have come up a bit since then, but the Buffett buy signal is hard to ignore.

Loews Market value: $15.6 billion

$15.6 billion Dividend yield: 0.5%

0.5% Forward P/E: 12.8

12.8 Analysts’ opinion: 1 buy, 0 overweight, 2 hold, 0 underweight, 0 sell Loews (L, $47.15) – not to be confused with home-improvement retailer Lowe’s (LOW) – is a New York City holding company that got its start in 1946 when Laurence Tisch and his brother Bob borrowed money from their parents to buy a hotel in New Jersey. Today, Loews owns or controls hotels, insurance companies, oil businesses, a packaging business and a $2.1 billion stock portfolio. Since 2014, Loews has repurchased 15% of its stock for $3 billion, reducing its share count from 373 million to 317 million. Going all the way back to 2008, Loews has retired 40% of its stock, giving the Tisches a bigger piece of the pie. Even farther back to 1970, it has reduced its share count by 75%. Its 89% ownership of CNA Financial (CNA) generates a majority of the company’s net income each quarter. In the third quarter, CNA made a $300 million profit from $2.6 billion in revenue. Loews’ overall profit was $278 million. Over the past 50 years, Loews has delivered an average compound annual return of 17%, compared to 10% for the S&P 500.

Viacom Market value: $13.0 billion

$13.0 billion Dividend yield: 2.5%

2.5% Forward P/E: 7.5

7.5 Analysts’ opinion: 8 buy, 1 overweight, 19 hold, 1 underweight, 0 sell Viacom (VIAB, $32.41) is the parent of TV media brands such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and many others. National Amusements Inc., the Redstone family holding company, holds 80% of the votes but only 10% of the economic interest. The same situation applies to CBS Corp. (CBS), its former stablemate. The two companies were separated in 2006 after merging only six years earlier. Today, it looks as though the two may reunite. CBS CEO Les Moonves was forced out as chief executive in September after sexual harassment and assault allegations came to light. Moonves did not want the merger to happen, but Shari Redstone, who runs National Amusements, is in favor of reuniting the two firms. “We simply do not see a buyer for CBS beyond Viacom, which is why it would make sense for CBS to proactively propose a Viacom transaction sooner than later as scale is becoming increasingly critical in the media industry,” BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a September note to clients. VIAB, at less than eight times analysts’ estimates of future earnings, is a good value stock.

J.M. Smucker Market value: $12.4 billion

$12.4 billion Dividend yield: 3.2%

3.2% Forward P/E: 12.9

12.9 Analysts’ opinion: 3 buy, 1 overweight, 10 hold, 1 underweight, 4 sell Once upon a time, J.M. Smucker (SJM, $107.98) was all about peanut butter (Jif) and jelly (Smucker’s) sandwiches. Then it acquired Folgers coffee for $3 billion in 2008; Big Heart Pet Brands, the maker of Meow Mix and Milk-Bone, for $5.8 billion in 2015; Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, the maker of Rachel Ray’s pet food brand, for $1.9 billion in April of this year. Almost $11 billion and a decade later, Smucker generates 61% of its revenue from coffee and pet food. It has transformed into a major player in two of the fastest-growing segments of the consumer goods sector. In addition to the acquisitions mentioned above, SJM announced in July that it is selling its U.S. Baking business, which includes Pillsbury, for $375 million to a private equity firm – a move that further cements its commitment to coffee and pet foods. “This transaction allows management to continue to execute on its strategy of increased emphasis and resource allocation to the large and growing coffee, pet food, and snack food businesses,” William Blair analyst Jon Andersen wrote shortly after the deal’s announcement.

CVS Health Market value: $78.3 billion

$78.3 billion Dividend yield: 2.7%

2.7% Forward P/E: 10.1

10.1 Analysts’ opinion: 18 buy, 0 overweight, 5 hold, 0 underweight, 0 sell Vertical mergers are defined as when “two or more firms, operating at different levels within an industry’s supply chain, merge operations.” CVS Health (CVS, $73.69) combining with health insurer Aetna (AET) is an example of a vertical merger. Like all big mergers, the CVS/Aetna tie-up went through an antitrust review by the Justice Department. The DoJ ruled that the deal could go ahead as long as Aetna sold its private Medicare drug plans – a small price to pay to become a dominant force in healthcare. “Investors should view this deal as an offensive move by both companies,” RBC Capital analyst George Hill said last November after the announcement of the $69 billion merger. “A vertically-integrated, consumer-centric value-based care model makes strong strategic sense and is not a short-sighted response to fears of Amazon entering the pharmacy space.” “Go big or go home” appears to be the motto in healthcare. CVS shareholders should ultimately benefit from its size and scale. The stock is well off its 52-week low of $60.14, so momentum clearly is building. CVS, which trades around 10 times earnings estimates, certainly belongs in any list of high-potential value stocks to buy.

Macy’s Market value: $11.2 billion

$11.2 billion Dividend yield: 4.1%

4.1% Forward P/E: 10.3

10.3 Analysts’ opinion: 4 buy, 0 overweight, 12 hold, 1 underweight, 3 sell The Macy’s (M, $36.75) Thanksgiving Parade is an annual tradition like no other, where thousands of New Yorkers and out-of-town visitors line up along the parade route to see some amazing floats and Santa Claus. It will enjoy its 94th edition this year. Macy’s, the business, hasn’t had nearly as smooth a ride, but it appears CEO Jeff Gennette has got the department store moving in the right direction. The retailer even is spending $200 million in 2018 on its top 50 stores. In 2019 and beyond, it plans to take the renovations to other locations outside its “Growth50.” The company’s second-quarter earnings report was a mixed bag, with flat sales and good profits combined with a stronger outlook for the second half of the year. Confident consumers should translate into a good holiday shopping season. Macy’s, which trades around 10 times forward earnings, is one of the better retail value plays at the moment. “(Macy’s is) very cheap here,” Metropolitan Capital Advisors CEO Karen Finerman told CNBC on Oct. 30. “I believe in the American consumer.”

Best Buy Market value: $19.4 billion

$19.4 billion Dividend yield: 2.5%

2.5% Forward P/E: 13.2

13.2 Analysts’ opinion: 6 buy, 0 overweight, 17 hold, 1 underweight, 3 sell Toys “R” Us is closing all its U.S. stores. Sears (SHLDQ) is operating under bankruptcy protection and has proposed closing 142 stores in a proposed Oct. 15 filing, though it wouldn’t be a shock if it closed more. The big question: How much business can Best Buy (BBY, $71.10) take from the two companies? Best Buy is expanding its toy inventory to grab a share of the $10.5 billion that Toys “R” Us left on the table when it permanently closed its doors at the end of June. Although it has sold tech-related toys in the past, 90% of its expanded inventory at the more than 1,000 U.S. stores will be new products for the retailer. Approximately 86% of Best Buy stores are located within 15 minutes of a Sears. Experts suggest Best Buy’s appliance business could gain as much as a quarter of a percentage point in same-store sales growth from Sears’ demise. Christmas can’t come soon enough.

Southwest Airlines Market value: $29.2 billion

$29.2 billion Dividend yield: 1.2%

1.2% Forward P/E: 10.6

10.6 Analysts’ opinion: 10 buy, 4 overweight, 4 hold, 0 underweight, 1 sell Investors have speculated about Warren Buffett buying Southwest Airlines (LUV, $51.42) at various times throughout 2018. At the end of June, Berkshire Hathaway owned approximately 56.6 million shares of the Texas airline. The $2.9 billion holding is one of the company’s most prominent equity positions. Buffett himself is on record saying he wouldn’t rule out owning an airline. Considering that, and fact that Berkshire Hathaway has money to burn, it’s understandable for investors to jump to this conclusion. Regardless of whether Buffett buys Southwest, it’s a well-run company. LUV will continue to look for growth in a business environment where fuel and non-fuel expenses alike are rising; it expects the cost per available seat mile to increase by as much as 3% in 2019. “Management indicated that its goal is to increase margins y/y in 2019, but the stock will come down as models update to reflect higher costs,” Stifel managing director Joseph DeNardi wrote in a note to clients. “The silver lining perhaps: a greater sense of urgency on Southwest’s part to be proactive on pricing to offset the higher (cost per available seat mile).”

Dollar Tree Market value: $20.4 billion

$20.4 billion Dividend yield: N/A

N/A Forward P/E: 14.1

14.1 Analysts’ opinion: 12 buy, 3 overweight, 12 hold, 0 underweight, 0 sell Dollar Tree (DLTR, $86.08) is a discount chain with dual personalities. First, you’ve got the legacy brand, which continues to grow and prosper. Its most recent Q2 2018 report saw same-store sales increase by 3.7%. Unfortunately, Family Dollar – the chain it acquired in 2015 for $9.1 billion and still operates under that name – experienced flat same-store sales. That knocked DLTR shares off by 15% in August. “Family Dollar remains the weaker part of the business,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, said in an investor note published in May. “It is more of a needs-based experience which caters for customers’ basic, everyday requirements. A far higher proportion of its shopper base goes there out of necessity rather than because they particularly want to.” Carl Icahn, the activist investor who made more than $200 million on Family Dollar back in 2015, has taken a position in Dollar Tree. Although he hasn’t revealed his plans for his investment, it’s likely he’ll push for the sale of Family Dollar. Tariffs are hitting Dollar Tree’s business in a big way – 40% of its products come from China – so the faster it can sell or revitalize Family Dollar, the better. The time to buy is now while investors are gloomiest.","Here are 10 large value stocks to buy now, with the expectation that they should thrive compared to their growthy brethren in a tumultuous environment.

87,"Feb 13, 2018",Kiplinger,Can Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett Save Health Care?,"The cost of providing health insurance to a company’s employees grew nearly 7% last year, extending not only a long-standing streak of rising costs, but accelerating that trend. Indeed, between 2002 and 2016, the average amount of money a family of four spent on health care each year grew a whopping 180%. Putting it bluntly: Regardless of who’s paying the bill (and how), health care has become expensive. It’s not surprising, then, that corporations that are at least partially responsible for providing employees with health insurance are finally pushing back against an industry that has had little incentive to contain costs. What is surprising is the collection of strange bedfellows that are uniting to stop unbridled health-care costs: Amazon.com (AMZN, $1,450.89), Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $214.38) and mega-bank JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $115.67). The trio just announced a joint venture intended to “check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.” The standalone company apparently is intended to serve the employees of the three companies in question. They have provided few details beyond that. However, despite the ambiguity of the joint venture, the players involved point to the potential for a new model that could shape things to come.

If so, that’s first and foremost a problem for health insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET). The Shape of Things to Come? The press release making the announcement was posted early Tuesday, Jan. 30, explaining why the new partnership was formed, but not describing exactly what it would do. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos writes, “Hard as it might be, reducing health care’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.” Berkshire’s iconic stock picker was more colorful, writing, “The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.” Buffett may have been more accurate than he wished he had been. There are no answers yet about what this venture will look like at the finish line. But the alliance does point to the shape of things to come. One aspect of containing health-care costs, for instance, is offering medical equipment or pharmaceuticals available at their cost. In light of the collective scale and multi-industry reach the three companies enjoy, the group has negotiating leverage. As Andrew Hart of Wallace Hart Capital Management pointed out, “These three companies employ over 1.1 million and health-care coverage would extend to their families, so this endeavor could cover 1 million to 3 million people. That’s an insurance pool similar in size to many U.S. states.” Broadly speaking, however, the consensus is that the joint venture ultimately will aim to displace insurers, which have done little to help contain health-care costs because they have little incentive to do so. While the industry’s landscape includes numerous insurers, there still aren’t enough of them in enough geographical markets to provide meaningful competition.

Loop Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba added that the standalone organization would lean heavily on Amazon’s technological expertise and Berkshire’s insurance operational experience. Regardless of what the final product is, most everyone agrees that the organization, if successful, will exert some much-needed pressure on pharmaceutical companies and suppliers of health-care service that haven’t been pressured enough for years. If and when the model is copied by other employers, look for even bigger cost cuts. Skeptics Remain Few would deny the United States’ health-care system is becoming less affordable, but not all analysts believe this trio of for-profit organizations can establish a game-changing nonprofit organization to take care of the 1 billion-plus workers they collectively employ. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James is one of those doubters, saying, “We do not expect this JV to be a meaningful disruptor to the industry, despite the stock reaction indicating that it is.” Cantor Fitzgerald health services analyst Steven Halper says the announcement has “more bark than bite at this point.” They may have valid points, considering that disparate players in the health-care arena also are starting to form vertical alliances. Case in point: Drugstore chain CVS Health (CVS) has agreed to acquire health insurer Aetna, melding at least one aspect of the health-care industry – dispensing pharmaceuticals – with another. It’s not just about selling drugs, however. CVS also operates 1,100 health clinics within its stores, providing simpler services like treating colds and other minor ailments that don’t merit an ER visit, and don’t require the hassle of making an appointment with a regularly seen primary care physician.","The cost of providing health insurance to a company’s employees grew nearly 7% last year, extending not only a long-standing streak of rising costs, but accelerating that trend.
Indeed, between 2002 and 2016, the average amount of money a family of four spent on health care each year grew a whopping 180%.
Putting it bluntly: Regardless of who’s paying the bill (and how), health care has become expensive.

What You Need To Know

Walmart confirmed Wednesday two changes to its official corporate name. First, it will drop the dash between ""Wal"" and ""Mart."" Second, it will be dropping the ""Stores"" part of its name to better reflect its status as being both an offline and online giant.

Why It's Important

Media outlets following Associated Press style have been referring to the company as Walmart, so the change is minimal, as the legal name is rarely used, President and CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Nevertheless, the name change is more consistent with the ""idea that you can shop us up however you like as a customer.""

In conjunction with the name change, the company said it struck a new agreement to sell Lord & Taylor branded items both in store and online.

What's Next?

Walmart incorporated its legal name in 1969 when it was known as Wal-Mart, Inc. and changed its name to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. the following year. It has kept the same name since then despite an aggressive push into online.

The legal name change becomes effective in February.

90,"May 15, 2018",Kiplinger,10 Stable Stocks to Buy Now for a Wobbly Market,"The past several weeks have been frustrating for investors. While an eight-day win streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed we’re clearly not in the throes of a bear market, things largely still aren’t very bullish, either. We’re still in the midst of a garden-variety correction, and as many traders have been reminded, corrections are a process rather than a short-lived event. The current process might not be completed just yet. Indeed, after an incredible unfettered runup over the course of 2017, it could be weeks before the market finds a true floor and is able to rekindle its former bullishness. That doesn’t necessarily mean investors must simply ride it out with what they have. The right stocks can minimize market volatility, and maybe even drive gains at a time of year that’s lethargic, at best. Here are 10 stocks to buy now for their resiliency, dependability and stability. Some are perennial winners, others are counter-cyclical plays and still others are special-situation opportunities. In all cases, however, these shares look relatively immune to the broad market’s uncertainty. Data is as of May 14, 2018.

Costco Wholesale Market value: $86.0 billion Think Costco Wholesale (COST, $195.88) is just another retailer? Think again. Although it clearly operates brick and mortar stores that invite consumers in for a shopping experience, that description doesn’t do Costco’s business model justice. This retailer was built from the ground up to also be a fee-based membership club, annually charging its customers for the privilege of spending money at its locales. It has worked. In its most recently reported quarter, membership fees accounted for $716 million in revenue, which accounted for the vast majority of the company’s $986 million in pretax income; membership fee revenue is almost all profit. Costco isn’t just a machine designed to drive membership fees. It has proverbial “buy-in” from consumers, and shoppers feel more compelled to get the most of their membership by frequenting the company’s stores more than they might otherwise. The average per-trip ticket size is much bigger at Costco than at any other comparable retailer, and on average, members spend about $2,500 per year with the company. For comparison, the average Amazon (AMZN) Prime member only spends about $1,300 at the e-commerce site per year. The fact that Costco mostly sells consumables bolsters the stability argument. Investors appreciate this kind of reliable revenue production when other companies face unclear futures.

Hormel Foods Market value: $19.0 billion Market turbulence might prompt consumers to rethink that splurge, and outright bear markets may postpone the purchase of an automobile. It’s rather uncommon for anyone to stop eating regardless of the economic environment, however. That leaves packaged-food company Hormel Foods (HRL, $36.08) in an enviable position. Hormel is the company that brings you Dinty Moore beef stew, Skippy peanut butter, Spam and a handful of canned goods with the Hormel label on them. You’ll find them in store refrigerators, on unrefrigerated shelves and even in places that use Jennie-O foodservice. Even within the anti-cyclical consumer goods sector, diversification counts. That geographic diversification rattled some shareholders just a few weeks ago, when the threat of new tariffs being imposed on foods sent from the United States to China first surfaced. Although Chinese President Xi Jinping has since backed off on those threats, the possibility lingers in the back of investors’ minds. But it might not need to. Hormel has what many other players in the business don’t have: scale. Although the company’s sales and profits ebb and flow like any other, the market knows full well that far more often than not, Hormel’s revenues and earnings roll in higher on a year-over-year basis. That easily makes it one of the top stocks to buy now for stability.

Cigna Market value: $42.8 billion Healthcare plan providers like Cigna (CI, $177.54) were certainly whipped around before and after the advent of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Its implosion in the meantime has only fanned the flames of volatility, with investors simply unsure of what the future held. But there’s more clarity on the horizon than these healthcare-focused blue-chip stocks (as a group) may be getting credit for. That growing stability is at least in part supported by the new normal in the healthcare arena – vertical integrations that will ultimately lead to cost savings. The union of drugstore chain CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) comes to mind. But Cigna is getting in on the act too with its effort to acquire pharmacy benefits manage Express Scripts (ESRX). Such deals are expected to provide consistency at the stage of drug reimbursement, which had previously been a point of friction within the healthcare sector. Investors are already pricing in that impending stability too. Cigna shares’ beta score, which compares its volatility to the broad market’s volatility, says it only swings about half as erratically as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index does. But it has handily outperformed the S&P 500 over the course of the past five years with a gain of 134%. The market’s only up about 67% for the timeframe.

Quest Diagnostics Market value: $13.9 billion In the same sense that food sales are resilient, so too is the use of diagnostic kits and the utilization of the laboratories that process them. Enter Quest Diagnostics (DGX, $102.93), the world’s largest medical diagnostics and testing company. Quest can identify and analyze everything from cancer to cholesterol to hepatitis C and more. This includes employment-driven drug-testing, which may translate into a particularly strong opportunity for the foreseeable future. With the nation’s unemployment rate now at a multi-year low of 3.9% and employers now fighting for – and possibly lowering their standards for – workers, Quest Diagnostics has observed something more than a little concerning. That is, positive drug tests (evidence that workers are drug users) are at a 10-year high. Though organizations are desperate for workers, no employer can afford the liability of an employee that may be under the influence while on the job. Look for demand for drug screening to ramp-up, in step with the fast-growing job market. Regardless, as was noted, disease diagnostics and drug-testing are the kind of services that aren’t overly subject to economically-based changes in the marketplace. While its top and bottom lines have fluctuated in the short run over the course of the past decade, the longer-term trajectory has been pointed decidedly upward. This kind of reliability makes DGX a favorite in turbulent times.

Diageo plc Market value: $89.0 billion It’s cliché, but clichés exist for a reason: Own booze company Diageo plc (DEO, $144.49) as a way of sidestepping the brunt of any pullback. The industry – and this company in particular – almost seems to thrive when most other equities are floundering, with alcohol making tough times a little easier to cope with. You may know the company better than you realize. Although it is based in the U.K., Diageo is the name behind iconic American brands like Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Captain Morgan, just to name a few. While popular in the United States, Diageo products are enjoyed in more than 180 countries, offering incredible geographic diversity to shareholders. It also offers owners oddly reliable, even if never red-hot, earnings and sales growth. The big selling point with Diageo, however, is its highly tempered volatility. With a beta reading of only 0.55, it’s only a little more than half as erratic as the S&P 500 index. That low beta reading also suggests it also sometimes moves counter to the overall market tide. More than anything, however, the low beta reading says DEO shares march to the beat of their own drum, reflecting the company’s steady growth.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities Market value: $12.8 billion When stocks as a whole start to struggle, investors are often quick to seek out other kinds of assets … commodities, bonds, and real estate. That’s why Jonathan Pappas, communications consultant for real estate PR firm Solomon McCown, thinks real estate investment trust (REIT) Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE, $126.98) could be a compelling alternative in the midst of this market turbulence. Pappas explains, “After last week’s Q1-2018 Alexandria earnings call, investors and analysts for the first time in Alexandria’s 24-year history heard Joel and leadership give increased visibility into their development/redevelopment pipeline for 2018-2019-2020. This news sent Alexandria’s stock up 4% on May 1.” He adds, “Another reason why the Street was excited about Alexandria’s long-term growth was because these Class A lab/office buildings currently under construction or pre-construction are already more than 80% pre-leased, on average – guaranteed cash flow over the next several years.” That impending cash flow makes ARE a lower-risk bet than many other equities, and REITs, when the overall market is being shaken and stirred. The kicker: Alexandria’s first-quarter top and bottom lines were both better than analysts were expecting. Revenues were up a healthy 18%, year-over-year, adding to the bullish response to the company’s new forward-looking transparency.

American Water Works Market value: $14.4 billion

$14.4 billion American Water Works (AWK, $82.67) is, to put it bluntly, a boring company. That’s meant as a compliment, though. Boring is beautiful if the alternative is an exciting but unpredictable future. Exactly as the name says, American Water Works operates water utility services, delivering water to 1,600 communities spread across 16 different states. What’s not put in print at the corporate website is that water utilities are about as much of a monopoly as an industry can get and still be permitted to operate. While competition theoretically is permitted, for all intents and purposes it’s simply too difficult for a community to tap another operator. It gets better. It wouldn’t be accurate to say it never happens, but it is rare for a municipality’s regulatory body to deny a water company’s request for a rate increase. Circle of Blue, which monitors the nation’s average monthly water bill paid by consumers, reports that the monthly cost of water has steadily grown every year since 2010, and by more than the broad inflation rate has. AWK shareholders aren’t complaining. American Water Works’ dividend yield of 2% isn’t much to celebrate, but shareholders know it’s among the best stocks to buy for dividend growth as well as safety. In 2010, AWK paid 63 cents per share. Now, it’s paying out at an annualized pace of $1.67 per share.

Walmart Market value: $249.0 billion Given its ongoing fight with Amazon, Target (TGT) and the aforementioned Costco – just to name a few -- one would expect Walmart (WMT, $84.39) shares to make their way all of the trading map, higher and lower. And to be fair, the company sees its fair share of erraticism. By and large, though, shares of the world’s biggest retailer are less than half as erratic as the S&P 500 has been over the course of the past year. It’s not terribly tough to figure out why. Its inherent problems aside, Walmart is a massive company with a finger in a lot of different pies ranging from groceries to automotive to several surprising high-end online ventures, all augmenting (of course) its core general merchandise operation. The sheer size of the company makes it a difficult outfit to push, pull or turn. The retailer’s stability goes beyond internal diversity. Its core product lines like home goods, kitchen supplies, hardware and electronics may not me outright recession-proof, but they’re quite recession-resistant. Consumers may not always be able to purchase a new car, but they won’t think twice about buying new socks or light bulbs.

Berkshire Hathaway Market value: $485.3 billion It might be cheating just a bit for an investor to delegate his or her stock-picking duties to someone else. But, if you’re going to go that route, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $199.18) is undoubtedly the way to go. The short version of the long story is, Buffett likes value stocks. He’s also a fan of companies that can consistently create cash flow, and given his historical preferences, the Oracle of Omaha has generally bought stocks that are inherently less volatile than the broad market – attributes that only took the world of academia five decades to officially figure out, even though Buffett has been willing to drop such hints for about as long. There may be another reason Berkshire Hathaway isn’t quite as erratic as the S&P 500. That is, though the fund holds a great number of publicly traded stocks, it also owns a great number of privately held businesses that can only be arbitrarily (and only occasionally) valued by accountants. Since those have no underlying stocks to speak of that create any meaningful measure of net asset value, the market tacitly acknowledges Berkshire must be valued only by its ability to create income. Ergo, Berkshire Hathaway shares aren’t pushed around by hysteria like most other equities are.","The right stocks can minimize market volatility, and maybe even drive gains at a time of year that’s lethargic, at best.

94,"Apr 26, 2018",ESPN,Zinedine Zidane's embodiment of Real Madrid values makes him Los Blancos' perfect boss,"In Paulo Condo's book, ""The Duellists,"" in which he details the bitter 14-day spell when Real Madrid and Barcelona faced each other four times at the end of the 2010-11 season, he describes a scene in the dressing room when Zinedine Zidane showed he would be the perfect manager for Real Madrid.

After being beaten 2-0 by Pep Guardiola's side in the Champions League semifinals with a plethora of talking points, including a red card for Pepe, Jose Mourinho essentially told his side to play for a 0-0 draw so they could complain about the injustice of the first leg afterward. Zidane was in the dressing room at the time, as he was working as a liaison between the manager and the board. He was asked to say a few words to the squad if he felt like it given his experience and the weight his words carried.

The Frenchman took his chance.

""You're fantastic players,"" he said, ""so you should try to beat Barcelona because Real Madrid try to win every game.""

All Zidane was offered in return was a frosty stare from Mourinho, but Zidane could not abide by the instructions. For better or worse, Zidane has lived by that statement since taking over in the dugout at the Santiago Bernabeu. Whether at home to Girona in the league or away to Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals, Real Madrid will never stop believing that they can and will win.

Real Madrid was long considered a place where world-class managers went to get put in their place, where the internal politics of the dressing room enveloped a manager's typical remit until they were fired or walked away. John Toshack's take on the inner sanctum is particularly suitable to recall: ""It was like Baghdad at wartime in that dressing room.""

There are still players who want more minutes and don't hide it when they are frustrated, but everything considered, Zidane has turned a once toxic environment into a harmonious one.

The players he has sprung to life are an embodiment of the kind of spirit that Zidane continues to pump into his side. For example, Lucas Vazquez, who was dropped entirely from the squad before the final in Turin against Atletico Madrid in 2014, was arguably Real Madrid's best player at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday night. A player considered not of the required level for Real Madrid by some, he vowed to stay and fight, and he has turned himself into a vital component in whatever strategy Zidane conjures up.

In-game, it's evident too. Keylor Navas' anticipation that saw him 6 yards off his line before Joshua Kimmich drove to the ball to the net to open the scoring might have been a confidence-killer, but he returned from the dead and pulled off a string of stops to save the visitors. Navas said after the game, ""There are times when things don't go the way you want, but you need to have the character and personality not to cave in."" It's a message delivered time and time again by this Real Madrid squad.

Marcelo is another case in point. He was left straggling back into position for that Kimmich goal. But he knew that he could and would change the game, as it was him who buried the equaliser into the bottom corner of the net just minutes later. After the Juventus second leg, Marcelo said, ""It was never going to happen to us like it did to Barcelona, because we are Real Madrid,"" in what was partly a dig but also his genuine belief that Los Blancos are immune to losing.

For as poor as he has been at times with his positional awareness, or lack thereof, he now has three goals in the Champions League knockout stages this season. He is another player who assumes the invincibility that Zidane offers with his presence.

It's only this year that Zidane has needed to show off his tactical acumen to get Real Madrid out of some very tight corners, and he is proving to be adept in that area too. And with that, the praise is flowing. He is not a Guardiola -- he's not even a Paco Jemez. He has a rare blend, though -- the soothing persona of Carlo Ancelotti with the tactical mastery of Mourinho and garners the respect that is only ever afforded to those with ""Ballon d'Or winner"" on their CV.

The 45-year-old has fused his lack of fear to make a change with his ability to make those changes, and it packs a punch. He also uses the respect he earned as a player along with the confidence president Florentino Perez has in him to his advantage. It has seen him redefine the criteria for how Los Blancos should hire their managers.

95,"Mar 22, 2018",Acoustical Society of America,The expression of emotion in the singing voice: Acoustic patterns in vocal performance,"In most of the studies on the singing voice in the literature, excerpts from established pieces, such as well-known Lieder or opera arias, have been used as the basis for emotion judgment. The drawback is that, as is generally the case in opera and song performances, the expression of emotion is inextricably linked to the underlying text, as prescribed by the libretto or the lyrics of songs. In addition, the melodies that composers have written for arias in operas or for lyrics in songs also carry substantial emotional information, as attested by the copious work on the emotional power of music (see the contributions in). It is important to separate the effect of the purely vocal factors in a singing performance from potential effects of the meaning of underlying language material such as verbal utterances or poems. In this article, we report the results of a study on the production of emotional expression (rather than perception) in singing. We asked professional opera singers to vocally portray different emotions by singing, using the normal musical scale as a carrier (a) a content-free phrase consisting of a sequence of meaningless syllables on the one hand, resembling speech without conveying semantic meaning, and (b) a sequence of schwa (/ə/) sounds which do not require any articulation, relying exclusively on phonation. These expressive recitations were comprehensively analyzed for the underlying acoustic structure by using advanced extraction techniques for a standard parameter set.

Synthetic review of the empirical findings on the effect of emotion on vocal parameters. Note: “—” indicates that no reliable data are available. In specific phonemes, as compared with neutral, “”: “bigger,” “higher,” “faster,” “more,” “steeper,” or “broader”; “<=”: both “smaller” and “equal” reported; “>=”: both “larger” and “equal” reported; “<>”: both smaller and bigger have been reported. *: similar results found in at least three studies on the singing voice. Adapted from, p. 436, and, pp. 792–795.

Compared with the relatively important number of studies on the nature of vocal expression of emotion in speech that generally use acoustic analyses of emotion portrayals by lay or professional actors (see, for reviews,), few published studies can be found for emotional expression in singing (see). Early on,had a singer convey different emotions by repeatedly singing a single note and simple melodic sequences, asking observers to name the emotions intended (surprise, fear-pain, sorrow, and anger–hate), and concluded that both single tones and melodies can convey emotional significance to the listener. The question of the vocal means that the singer uses to convey emotional significance and the cues that transmit this information to the listener could only be addressed after practicable methods of acoustic measurement had been developed. In an early study,asked 11 professional singers to sing different vocal music scores to portray four basic emotions—happiness, sorrow, fear, and anger—and asked listeners to recognize the intended emotions. Performances recognized as sad were characterized by a slow rate or tempo, whereas perceived anger was associated with a higher average level and faster syllable onsets and decays of sound pressure., asked 14 professional singers to sing a phrase from Schubert's “Der Erlkönig” that portrayed four different emotions, anger, joy, fear, and sadness, and asked listeners to rate the strength of the perceived emotions for each performance. An analysis of the acoustic parameters linked to the perceived emotions showed that anger was associated with the presence of vibrato, whereas sadness was characterized by the absence of vibrato with longer durations (slower tempi) and with low voice intensity. In a case study,asked a professional singer to sing excerpts from Lieder and opera repertoires in two contrasting fashions: (a) as in an imagined concert situation, and (b) in an emotionally neutral way, i.e., without any particular interpretation or emotional coloring. A group of experienced experts in singing then judged both versions of each extract in terms of the degree of expressivity and the particular emotion conveyed (secure, loving, sad, happy, scared, angry, and hateful). The acoustic analysis revealed that emotion portrayals characterized by higher arousal levels (happy, scared, angry, and hateful) were associated with louder singing (higher sound pressure level), faster tempi, and a higher rate of loudness variation when compared with renderings of low arousal (secure, loving, and sad)., in a comprehensive review of earlier research on the vocal expression of emotion in speech and music, listed 104 references, of which only 16 consisted of empirical studies of singing, the large majority of them being contributions to conferences. The authors concluded that the acoustic patterns in the frequency, energy, spectral, and time domains for the expression of different emotions are similar for speech and music (including singing). As a summary of the current state of the art, we have compiled a synthesis of the extensive reviews provided by, and, shown in Table I . For the four most frequently studied emotions, we indicate the direction of acoustic changes for these emotions (in relation to neutral voice) for a number of the most frequently measured acoustic parameters. Patterns for which there is sufficient evidence (at least three studies) from studies using the singing rather than the speaking voice are marked by asterisks. These empirically found patterns (which largely confirm the theoretical predictions made by; see Table VI in) can be regarded as hypotheses for future work in this area, including the current study.

The work on the expression and recognition of emotion via nonverbal aspects of speech (e.g., voice quality) has almost exclusively focused on the speaking voice. Consequently, an examination of whether similar expression production patterns can be found in singing is of great interest, as well as whether emotions are equally well recognized from singing and from speaking. This is to be expected as both opera and song performances strongly rely on the singer's ability to convey authentic emotions to the audience, suggesting that listeners can indeed correctly recognize the singer's expressive intentions.

Because of the important evolutionary function of emotions, a premium is placed on expressing them as reliably as possible and on observers inferring their meaning as accurately as possible. Although much research has investigated the role of the face in this process, work on the voice lags behind in elucidating the effects of different emotions on the vocal mechanisms, the acoustic cues generated, and the nature of the processes that allows listeners to recognize affective states. Arguably, vocal communication of emotion has evolved for two functional reasons: to allow the expressor to reliably inform the social environment about his or her evaluation of the current situation and potential actions that this might give rise to, and to allow the observer a degree of prediction about what to expect during an interaction with the expressor (see also). Starting withmonumental monograph on the expression of emotion in man and animals, the study of how different emotions are expressed in the face, voice, and body and how well the underlying affective states can be recognized by conspecific observers has been, and still is, a central domain of emotion research. A recent review of the literature () has shown that the results of 135 studies provide an overwhelming amount of evidence for the human capacity to infer a person's emotion from his/her nonverbal expression with a degree of accuracy that by far exceeds chance expectations. The bulk of this work reports accuracy data for facial expression (mostly based on still photos and recent work on dynamic video expression samples). Voice, posture, and gesture have received much less attention. However, the comprehensive review shows there is now also a fair amount of evidence that emotions can be reliably recognized with a similar degree of accuracy from vocal expressions (using meaningless vocalizations). An important aspect of this evidence is that accuracy rates differ between the modalities, with some emotions recognized more accurately from the face (e.g., disgust) and others from the voice (e.g., anger). The strong emphasis on perception and recognition accuracy is responsible for the dearth of empirical work on the production of expression and the nature and patterns of the expressive features in the different modalities (or communication channels) that characterize specific emotions. However, in recent years, important advances have been made to develop tools that allow sophisticated analyses of the specific features and feature configurations that characterize the production (or encoding) of specific emotions in different expression modalities. Thus, the work by Ekman and his collaborators (see) on “facial action units” (AUs) has spurned a sizeable body of work on the specific AUs and AU configurations that are typically found in expressions of specific emotions. Similarly, in the domain of vocal expression, advances in digital acoustic voice analysis techniques have led to a number of major investigations into the pattern of acoustic parameters (voice energy, fundamental frequency, spectral energy distribution, etc.) that characterize the vocal expression of specific emotions ().

An initial analysis showed a pattern of high correlations among the selected individual variables and scales. This co-linearity is mostly due to the strong effect voice energy or intensity on other acoustic parameters. Even though this parameter is mainly controlled by subglottal pressure, it also is influenced by the frequency distance between the first formant and the partial closest to it. As explained above, here we use the psychoacoustic derivative of energy, loudness, as a measure of this factor. The results reported in the literature suggest that loudnesscan be considered a type of superfactor (), and thus we used regression analysis to partial loudnessout of the composite variables most highly correlated with loudness(because of the interdependencies in voice production) and to work with the resulting residual scores to examine the effects of the respective spectral measures independent of overall energy. Specifically, loudnesswas partialed out of the measures for rising and falling slopes of0 and loudnessvalues, as well as out of the perturbation and low frequency energy measures (these variables are marked by the prefix “_” in text and tables below).

In addition, we used the following individual variables in further analyses: F 0 mean, F 0 variation, F 0 range (between the 20th and 80th percentiles), loudness ae variation, and loudness ae range (between the 20th and 80th percentiles). Notably, the normal standard deviation measures were not used for the variables, as they tend to correlate highly with the mean in acoustic research. Instead, we used the normalized coefficient of variation to measure the degree of variation of different types of parameter values.

The extraction of acoustic parameters using the GEMAPS procedure as described in the Method section yielded a total of 115 variables, including the distribution measures of the different parameters: mean (M), standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and percentiles (Perc). To allow for a reasonably compact analysis of these acoustical data, we selected principle parameters used in previous research from the established acoustical dimensions of human voice sounds (see). The calculation of scales that combined highly correlated variables was largely based on the accumulated results of principal components analyses (PCAs) reported in earlier work (). Given the important role of individual differences in the architecture of the vocal tract and voicing mechanisms, we computed standardized scores (scores) separately for each of the singers to allow direct comparison between emotions. Specifically, we computed the combined scales listed below. Most of the variables in these combinations are standard acoustic measures, except for the Hammarberg-Index, the Alpha Ratio, and Loudness. The following abbreviations are used in the list below (M = mean, Perc80 = 80th percentile, CV = Coefficient of variance, Variation = mean of CV measures):Formant values here refer to the automatically extracted frequencies of spectrum envelope peaks rather than to real vocal tract resonances. Formant frequency measurement is based on Linear Predictive Coding with predictor order= 11 at 16 kHz sampling rate, followed by root-solving of the linear predictor polynomial to determine poles of the linear system described by the predictor polynomial. Furthermore, given the difficulty of automatic fundamental frequency and formant measurement at high frequencies, some values might be less reliable. However, the sung material did not contain extremely high notes and the data were checked for outliers.

The review of the results on recognition accuracy of vocally portrayed emotions in speech reported above (based on) had shown that contempt is not well recognized from the voice and some singers had commented that it was difficult to portray love, serenity, or tense arousal out of context. Furthermore, only five singers produced samples for love, contempt, serenity, and tense arousal (see Methods). Therefore, we decided to drop these four emotions (that had been added to the original list in the course of the recordings) from all further analyses to have a sufficiently largefor statistical power.

We automatically extracted the GEMAPS standard parameter set as well as a few additional parameters from the extended version (see). The complete list of acoustic parameters extracted is reproduced in the supplementary material.The large majority of the parameters extracted are well known, standard acoustic parameters, with the possible exception of the Hammarberg-Index, defined as the difference between the maximum energy in the 0–2 kHz and the 2–5 kHz band () and the Alpha Ratio, defined as the ratio between the summed energy in the 50–1000 kHz band to the summed energy in the 1–5 kHz band (see). Furthermore, rather than using the raw sound pressure level measurements for energy or intensity, in this article we computed a psychoacoustic derivative, acoustically estimated loudness, which has been shown to be better correlated to vocal affect dimensions than the raw signal energy (). In what follows, we refer to this acoustic estimate of loudness as loudnessIt consists of a weighted sound pressure level, where various frequency bands are weighted according to their relevance for human perception, as suggested by Zwicker's Loudness model (). In GEMAPS, a simplified estimation algorithm is used, a modified version of the original algorithm described infurther details can be found in

Previous research on voice in speech and singing has made remarkable progress in terms of the computer-based extraction of acoustic parameters (cf.). However, this has resulted in a proliferation of acoustic parameters that are often used selectively and are not always extracted in a comparable fashion. For direct comparison and accumulation of results across studies, it is essential to develop a shared set of parameters and comparable extraction systems. Recently, from the initiative of a group of leading researchers in this area, a standardized acoustic parameter set was proposed, the Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (GEMAPS) (). In contrast to the large brute-force parameter sets used in machine learning settings (with several thousand parameters), GEMAPS consists of a much smaller set of voice parameters, selected on the basis of their (a) potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production; (b) proven value in former studies on speaking and singing by males and females, as well as automatic extractability; and (c) theoretical significance [a list of the low-level parameters and the major functionals is provided in the supplementary material]. The GEMAPS is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and to eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters. An automatic extraction implementation is publicly available with the openSMILE toolkit (, Appendix). Comparative evaluations of the proposed feature set with large baseline feature sets of INTERSPEECH challenges (cf.) show a high performance of the proposed set in relation to its size ().

One tenor was recorded at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève. A Sennheiser HSP-4EW head-worn microphone was used (cardioid pick-up pattern, condenser capsule), placed at the corner of his mouth. The audio signal was recorded by a professional sound engineer on dedicated hardware, at 96 kHz, 24-bit, on a single mono channel. One soprano and one mezzo-soprano were recorded under the same conditions at a recording room in a laboratory at the university. A Neumann BCM-104 broadcast microphone was used (cardioid pick-up pattern, condenser capsule), placed at approximately 1.5 m in front of the singer, at the height of the mouth. Before digitization, the audio signal passed through a Soundcraft RW5674 LX716-II audio console, where it was split into two separate channels. One of the two signals was attenuated by 20 dB, while the other was left untouched. This 20 dB separation increases the dynamic range covered during quantization. Later on, when analyzing recordings containing low-intensity vocal performances, one typically uses the high gain channel, as a larger portion of the dynamic range is covered, whereas for high-intensity vocal performances where the high gain channel is likely to saturate, one can fall back on the low gain channel. These two signals were then digitized and recorded on a PC equipped with a Digigram VX882HR sound card, at 44.1 kHz, 16-bit. The remaining five singers were recorded in a studio of the Swiss Radio Corporation in Geneva, using the same procedure as described above with the following equipment: microphone: AKG C-414 xls, preamplifier micro: Sonosax SX-PR, and recorder: Marantz PMD 661.

We used one of the standard phrases that was successfully used for the construction of a large corpus of emotion expression in speech (GEMEP;) for the spoken enactment “ne kal ibam soud molen” and the sustained vowel /ə/. The singers were asked to sing both types of material as a combined ascending-descending musical scale, imagining that they wanted to project emotional color in their interpretation of a lyrical work.

With respect to the emotions to be interpreted, we originally chose a subset of the categories that had been used in the spoken expression studies referred to above that seemed appropriate for interpretation in the context of an opera libretto, namely, admiration, anxiety, anger, despair, fear, joy, pride, sadness, and tenderness. Based on feedback from the singers (e.g., that anxiety and despair were difficult to differentiate from fear and sadness), we developed a new set of emotions, retaining six of the original list and adding four others, as well as specifying the nature of the emotion by using another term from the same emotion family. The following list was provided for the portrayals: agitated fear, animated joy, triumphant pride, anger/rage, sadness/depression, tenderness/compassion plus passionate love, tense arousal, calm/serenity, condescension/contempt. Depending on the singer's preference, this list was provided in English, German, or French and questions as to the precise meaning of the emotion categories were discussed before the recording session started.

We recorded eight professional opera singers, seven of whom regularly interpret major roles in leading international opera houses (one singer having completed her training at the conservatory and starting her career): two sopranos, two mezzo-sopranos, two tenors, one countertenor, and one bass-baritone. The singers were recorded in two groups. First, a tenor, a soprano, and a mezzo-soprano; second, another tenor, another soprano, another mezzo-soprano, a countertenor, and a bass-baritone. Based on the feedback from the first group of singers, we slightly changed the list of emotions to be portrayed, and for practical reasons, the recording arrangements (see the two sections below for further detail).

Finally, we analyzed the extent to which our acoustic variables vary with respect to the classic superordinate three-dimensional space in which the emotions are located, formed by Valence (good–bad), Power (strong–weak), and Arousal (calm–excited) (). For this purpose, we assigned dimension component scores to each emotion portrayed by the singers on the basis of the large-scale cross-cultural work on semantic profiles of major emotion terms by, Chap. 13). To determine the predictive power of the acoustic components, we then regressed them on the semantic profile scores separately for the Valence, Power, and Arousal dimensions, using the stepwise criterion for entry into the equation to obtain the most economical predictor sets. Table VI shows the acoustic components entered in each case, as well as their beta weights, with significance level and the overall(amount of variance explained). The results show that the Valence dimension is the least well predicted (and the betas barely reach significance). In contrast, for both Power and Arousal more than 50% of the variance (> 0.5) are accounted for by the respective predictor sets (with all beta coefficients being highly significant). The two predictor sets are highly similar which is probably due to sadness and tenderness being low, and anger and joy being high on both Valence and Arousal.

We also computed a multiple discriminant analysis for the six acoustic component scores with stepwise entry of the best predictors to examine the extent to which a smaller subset of the acoustic variables would allow us to correctly classify the six emotions studied. Table V(a) shows the confusion matrix resulting after the best five predictors had been entered. A total of 45.3% of cases were correctly classified by using the cross-validation criterion, with joy being somewhat less well classified than the other emotions. Table V(b) shows the standardized canonical discriminant function coefficients for the five acoustic components that were entered into the equation, identifying the relationships between the predictors. AC1 is mostly determined by low loudnessand low dynamics, AC2 by high loudnessand high perturbation variation, and AC3 by formant amplitude. Table V(c) lists the means of the unstandardized discriminant functions for each emotion, allowing us to examine which emotions were best discriminated by which function. As could be expected on the basis of thecomparisons reported in Table IV , anger is best differentiated from sadness and tenderness by function 1 (high vs low loudnessand dynamics), pride and fear are best differentiated by function 2 (high vs low loudnessand perturbation variation), and anger and sadness tend to be differentiated from joy by function 3 (high vs low formant amplitude).

These results show that the 16 variables can be reduced to six major components without losing too much explanatory power. We labeled the six acoustic components as follows: AC1_Loudness, AC2_Dynamics, AC3_Perturbation Variation, AC4_Low Frequency Energy, AC5_Formant Amplitude, and AC6_0. Figureshows the means of the component score scales for each of the six emotions. We then computed a MANOVA withcomparisons for the six component scores. Table IV shows the results of this analysis.

The relatively large number of acoustic variables makes it difficult to discern the underlying patterns, especially as there seems to be a lot of redundancy in the pattern of theanalyses. Therefore, we computed an exploratory Principal Component analysis (PCA) of the variable set to examine the feasibility of reducing the dependent variable set to a smaller number of orthogonal components. The PCA extracted six components (based on the knee in the scree plot), explaining 84% of the variance, which were rotated with the varimax criterion. The rotated component matrix is shown in Table III . The first component is focused around different aspects of sound level, suggesting high voice intensity or energy. The second component, tempo, perturbation, and steep rise/fall slopes for0 and sound level, seems to connote activation or arousal. The third component combines perturbation and0 variation, suggesting a strong degree of microvariation. The fourth component is focused on low frequency energy (with a negative relationship between level and variation). The fifth component links loudnessvariation with low formant amplitude. The final, sixth component, reflects0 level and range. The low number of important cross-loadings suggests that partialing out sound level from some of the parameters substantially reduced the collinearity.

Many of the patterns found confirm the predictions listed in Table I . In particular, the extreme positions of sadness and anger on many of the parameters is clearly replicated: Anger is lowest on0 variation, highest on loudness, and low on loudnessvariation, Highest on steepness of0 and Loudnessrise and fall slopes, high on perturbation, low on formant bandwidth, and fastest on tempo whereas sadness is generally on the opposite end of the respective continuum. However, it is interesting to note that tenderness (for which we do not have stable predictions) is in some cases even more extremely opposed to anger as sadness. Interestingly, we do not find the strong effect that was predicted for lower low frequency energy in anger—while the result is in the right direction, there is no significant effect (as it is generally found for speech expression). As expected by the many predictions of no change (or both directions possible) for fear and joy, the positions of these two emotions vary greatly depending on the parameter, suggesting a high degree of complexity of the acoustic profiles. Pride (for which we also have no reliable predictions) shows an interesting profile, with very variable positions with respect to the other emotions and extreme (high) positions on0 percentile range, loudnesslevel, and formant frequency and amplitude, suggesting a strong,(see Table V of).

We first examined the effects of the singers' emotion targets on the acoustic parameters by using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) over the complete selected variable set described above to obtain an indication of the extent to which the six chosen emotions produced significant differences in these variables (main effects for the Emotion factor, using partial eta squares to obtain effect size estimates). We also used a Material factor in the analysis, representing the difference between singing scales and phrases, to check for the possibility of interaction effects between emotion and material effects. In addition, we computedanalyses for each of the variables by using Tukey'scriterion to obtain significantly homogeneous subgroups of emotions. As the main effects for Material are of no interest in the present context (the difference between sustained schwa sounds in the scales and meaningless vowel-consonant combinations in the content-free phrases will produce acoustic differences) and since only one variable (tempo) showed a slightly significant (= 0.031) interaction effect, only the results for the Emotion main effects are reported in Table II . Except for0 mean and range, the Emotion main effects are all highly significant with remarkably high effect sizes, indicating powerful effects of the emotion interpretation on the singers' voice production.

In this study, we examined the effects of a singer's interpretation of different types of emotion on a number of central acoustic parameters and the capacity of these parameters to allow statistical discrimination of the intended expressive targets. In order to do so, we analyzed experimental recordings of content-free emotion portrayals of sung musical scales.

vocalises from published scores: not reported here). One limitation of having only six emotion categories is that the classification rate has to be interpreted with caution (although only very few studies in the literature on vocal recognition use more categories; see Scherer et al., 2011 In the eye of the beholder? Universality and cultural specificity in the expression and perception of emotion ,” Int. J. Psychol. 46(6), 401– 435 . https://doi.org/10.1080/00207594.2011.626049 36. Scherer, K. R., Clark-Polner, E., and Mortillaro, M. (2011). “,” Int. J. Psychol.(6), 401– Given the nature of the singers involved and of the somewhat unusual task, it is not surprising that the study suffers from a number of shortcomings and limitations with respect to experimental rigor, especially as the recordings were made over a relatively long period. We had wanted to use mostly world-class opera singers with long experience in expressive interpretations on stage because we felt that their success with the persons responsible for casting in operas and other vocal music performances as well with the expert public were the best indicator for the ability to produce credible and effective vocal performances. In addition, we felt that they would have sufficient mastery to produce authentic interpretations in a laboratory/studio setting allowing us to measure the corresponding acoustic profiles. In consequence, we could not increase the number of singers (which would have been desirable for increasing the number of observations and thus statistical power) because we depended on such artists coming to perform on a Geneva stage and their willingness to donate their precious time for a scientific study. As a consequence, a minority of the singers were recorded in a different environment with slightly different equipment. Furthermore, not all singers interpreted all emotions and all materials (a few singers also sang classicfrom published scores: not reported here). One limitation of having only six emotion categories is that the classification rate has to be interpreted with caution (although only very few studies in the literature on vocal recognition use more categories; see). The advantage is that the recordings for which acoustic analyses are reported in this article are comparable for all eight singers involved with respect to the emotions portrayed, the two types of scales sung (with schwa /ə/ and meaningless sequences of phonemes), and the quality of the digital sound recordings. As a result, we believe that at least the more robust of our findings should generalize to other groups of singers.

One important finding is that the type of vocal material used—voiced only (scales sung with /ə/) and voice/unvoiced phonemes (meaningless syllables)—did not affect the differences between emotions. A MANOVA showed that although there are some significant differences (especially for Loudnessae Rise/Fall, Perturbation, and Tempo—all part of the Dynamics component—which are higher for the more speech-like, meaningless syllable scale portrayals), there was only one negligible interaction effect for Material × Emotion. This suggests that it is possible to disregard differences for voiced/unvoiced material to some extent in studying emotional expression differences.

1 ae and dynamics and high perturbation variation (and a tendency for high low-frequency energy). Sadness differs from tenderness by showing a high level of formant amplitude. As to question 1, the effects of different emotional interpretations, Fig.shows the vocal signatures of the different emotions (for the six components), highlighting the similarities between sadness and tenderness on the one hand, and joy and pride on the other, which are also underlined by the strong mutual confusions in the classification results for multiple discriminant analysis shown in Table V(a) . Sadness and tenderness, as also shown in the MANOVA results in Table IV , are characterized by very low loudnessand dynamics and high perturbation variation (and a tendency for high low-frequency energy). Sadness differs from tenderness by showing a high level of formant amplitude.

post hoc patterns in terms of the PCA component structure suggests that this may reflect a fundamental difference between high arousal and power in the case of anger and low arousal/absence of power in the case of sadness and tenderness. Joy and pride are generally close to anger, although less extreme, also indicating a relatively high amount of power and arousal. Pride is generally higher on the variables loading on component 1 (voice intensity), which may be directly related to power. This suggests that power is relatively more important than arousal. The opposite seems to be true for joy (which would fit the appraisal theory-based predictions presented in the introduction). Fear is generally in between the two extremes, with a more extreme position only on low formant amplitude. Joy and pride are characterized by high loudnessae and low formant amplitude. Pride is distinguished from joy by high perturbation variation. Anger has a distinctive vocal profile with very strong loudnessae and very high dynamics. Fear has a nondescript profile with fairly level dynamics standing out [this may explain the frequent confusions with almost all other emotions except pride shown in Table Interestingly, these effects are dominated by the strong contrast between anger on the one hand and sadness/tenderness on the other. An interpretation of thepatterns in terms of the PCA component structure suggests that this may reflect a fundamental difference between high arousal and power in the case of anger and low arousal/absence of power in the case of sadness and tenderness. Joy and pride are generally close to anger, although less extreme, also indicating a relatively high amount of power and arousal. Pride is generally higher on the variables loading on component 1 (voice intensity), which may be directly related to power. This suggests that power is relatively more important than arousal. The opposite seems to be true for joy (which would fit the appraisal theory-based predictions presented in the introduction). Fear is generally in between the two extremes, with a more extreme position only on low formant amplitude. Joy and pride are characterized by high loudnessand low formant amplitude. Pride is distinguished from joy by high perturbation variation. Anger has a distinctive vocal profile with very strong loudnessand very high dynamics. Fear has a nondescript profile with fairly level dynamics standing out [this may explain the frequent confusions with almost all other emotions except pride shown in Table V(a) ].

ae and dynamics and, as expected, discriminates sadness and tenderness from all others, in particular anger. Function 2 combines high perturbation variation with loudnessae and most clearly discriminates pride and fear. Function 3 is determined by formant amplitude and discriminates sadness (and anger) from joy (and tenderness). This type of analysis of the discriminant functions is not based on any inferential statistics, but it fits well with the classification results and the MANOVA results, including the significant separation of the emotions into homogeneous subgroups by Tukey post hoc analyses (Table ae component is by far the most important discriminating factor, showing the strongest effect of the interpretation intention of the singers, followed by perturbation variation, dynamics, and formant amplitude. The F0 and low frequency energy components play only minor role, which may seem surprising given the important role of F0 as a marker of arousal documented in the literature ( Scherer, 2003 Vocal communication of emotion: A review of research paradigms ,” Speech Commun. 40, 227– 256 . https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-6393(02)00084-5 34.

Bull., 770– F0 is obvious, as singers had to adhere to the frequencies prescribed by the musical scale and consequently could not use this acoustic parameter for expressive effects. This is not a limitation of the present study but of singing in general—singers of opera and Lieder always have to follow a score (of course, under normal, non-experimental conditions, the composer will obviously use F0 level and variation to express arousal). Despite the imposed F0 contours, our results show that singers do manage to introduce minor F0 variations to bolster their emotional interpretation. The small effect of spectral energy variation is possibly due to the fact that loudnessae has been partialed out of the respective parameters, underlining the need to come to grips with the strong collinearity among acoustic parameters if one wants to understand the underlying mechanisms. As to question 2, the capacity of the selected acoustic parameters and components to allow statistical classification of the emotions [Table V(a) ] and the overall accuracy of 45.3% using cross-validation (as compared to 16.7% expected by chance) suggest a reasonable potential to allow automatic discrimination on the basis of the current parameter set. Table V (part b and part c) provides some qualitative indication of the underlying structures: The first discriminant function is characterized by low loudnessand dynamics and, as expected, discriminates sadness and tenderness from all others, in particular anger. Function 2 combines high perturbation variation with loudnessand most clearly discriminates pride and fear. Function 3 is determined by formant amplitude and discriminates sadness (and anger) from joy (and tenderness). This type of analysis of the discriminant functions is not based on any inferential statistics, but it fits well with the classification results and the MANOVA results, including the significant separation of the emotions into homogeneous subgroups by Tukeyanalyses (Table IV ). These results also support the conclusion one can draw from the significance levels and effect size estimates in Table IV —the loudnesscomponent is by far the most important discriminating factor, showing the strongest effect of the interpretation intention of the singers, followed by perturbation variation, dynamics, and formant amplitude. The0 and low frequency energy components play only minor role, which may seem surprising given the important role of0 as a marker of arousal documented in the literature (). The reason for the small effect of0 is obvious, as singers had to adhere to the frequencies prescribed by the musical scale and consequently could not use this acoustic parameter for expressive effects. This is not a limitation of the present study but of singing in general—singers of opera and Lieder always have to follow a score (of course, under normal, non-experimental conditions, the composer will obviously use0 level and variation to express arousal). Despite the imposed0 contours, our results show that singers do manage to introduce minor0 variations to bolster their emotional interpretation. The small effect of spectral energy variation is possibly due to the fact that loudnesshas been partialed out of the respective parameters, underlining the need to come to grips with the strong collinearity among acoustic parameters if one wants to understand the underlying mechanisms.

ae and dynamics components, which are likely due to high power and arousal characteristics of the emotions with high levels on these components, confirm the results of the earlier studies briefly referred to in the introduction and are also largely consistent with established findings in the vocal expression of emotion in the speaking voice (see Scherer et al., 2015 Comparing the expression of emotion in the speaking and the singing voice ,” Comput.

The opposite is true for sadness and tenderness. One lead in trying to understand this relationship may be a consideration of the type of voice quality involved and its effect on perturbation such as jitter and shimmer. It has been argued (see Table V of Scherer, 2003 Vocal communication of emotion: A review of research paradigms ,” Speech Commun. 40, 227– 256 . https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-6393(02)00084-5 34.

The potentially important role of formant amplitude, differentiating joy and sadness, less explored so far, is interesting and worthy of being studied further, especially as it may be linked to valence differences that are extremely difficult to capture with acoustic parameters. The important role of perturbation—level (mean) and variation—requires further investigation, as the underlying mechanisms are highly complex. Thus, as shown for the individual scales in Table I , the emotions that have a high score on (residualized) perturbation(joy, anger, and fear) have low scores on perturbation(i.e., the normalized standard deviation or coefficient of variation that measures the variability of jitter, shimmer, and harmonic/noise changes). The opposite is true for sadness and tenderness. One lead in trying to understand this relationship may be a consideration of the type of voice quality involved and its effect on perturbation such as jitter and shimmer. It has been argued (see Table V of) that the vocal expression of high power/high arousal emotions such as anger and joy involves avoice quality (“overall tensing of vocal apparatus, decreased salivation:0 and amplitude increase, jitter and shimmer, increase in high frequency energy, narrow1 bandwidth, pronounced formant frequency differences”), whereas low power/low arousal emotions are characterized by avoice (hypotonus of vocal apparatus: low0 and restricted0 range, low amplitude, weak pulses, very low high-frequency energy, spectral noise, format frequencies tending toward neutral setting, broad1 bandwidth). In a survey of the literature on perturbation, especially jitter,find some evidence for the existence of different types of perturbation depending on voice quality. Indeed, one would expect that the rapid vibration of very tense vocal folds with much variation due to dynamic intonation leads to a different type of perturbation (possibly characterized by very high excursions) compared with more slowly vibrating lax folds that may produce higher overall variation of the deviations due to wobbling. It should be noted that, in a strictly physical sense, perturbation reflects cycle-to-cycle variation and when applied to speech, this variation is typically quasi-random. In singing, the vibrato creates a nonrandom variation of cycle-to-cycle variation, and this variation is also reflected in perturbation measures. Vibrato effects in singing are often discussed in the literature on the expressiveness of singing and the quality of a singing voice (). The complex role of vibrato characteristics in the expressiveness of singing is an important issue to examine in more detail in future research.

These findings provide a first step in understanding the underlying mechanisms that are involved in the acoustic patterning of specific emotions, as the three major dimensions can be explained, in large part, by the nature of the emotion antecedent appraisal and the respective action tendencies and physiological concomitants: Power represents high coping potential and antagonistic, forceful action and Arousal represents in large part the result of the appraised urgency of action in response to an event (which may explain the greater importance of the Dynamics aspect compared with Power). The regression of the acoustic components on the semantic profile scores characterizing the superordinate dimensions of the emotions studied in affective space confirmed earlier assumptions (for example,) about the voice being particularly suited for the expression of power/dominance and arousal and less able to clearly express valence (the opposite of what is true for facial expression). Only about 10% of the variance in valence can be explained by the best two predictors (negative emotions being higher on Dynamics and Formant Amplitude). In contrast, over 50% of the variance can be explained for Power and Arousal, to a large extent by three major acoustic components: high Loudness, strong Dynamics, and low Formant Amplitude and Low Frequency Energy. Arousal is also predicted by low Perturbation Variation.

96,"Feb 13, 2018",,Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew The Retail Pitch?,"Groceries, until recently an insular market in the fiercely competitive retail zone, may see a radical shift in the days to come. The landscape is seeing a rapid change, with more players jumping on the offline bandwagon. The latest move in this space comes from Amazon AMZN, which is offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach. This is perhaps the beginning of a battle that will only intensify in the days and months to come.

The move comes within a year of the e-commerce giant's $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. Customers in Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach can now order fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items that their local Whole Foods stores stock.

Such a move was expected by Amazon given that it has specific plans of exploring and adding novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction. Needless to say, this will most likely set alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar grocers that so long rested assured of business safety.

Consumer Focus Route to Success

That said, besides sparking fear among the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, the two-hour free delivery service has been introduced keeping in mind customer demands. Consumers look for convenience and good bargains and Amazon is focusing on both. Per a Walker Sands survey, 40% would buy groceries online if they were less expensive and 23% would for it if it were more convenient.

The Whole Foods acquisition was certainly a strategic move by Amazon and perhaps the best option, as most of its other technology-driven food delivery initiatives such as Amazon Go have faltered. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods' 450 stores across the United States, thus giving it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Dollar Tree DLTR and Dollar General DG. Target has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

In doing so, the first step taken by the e-commerce behemoth was to slash prices of avocados, eggs, fruits, fish and prepared food by as much as 50%. Now, its two-hour, free-delivery service is only going to heat up competition for brick-and-mortar grocers. The idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient.

According to David J. Livingston, a supermarket analyst for DJL Research, people generally buy the same groceries every week. And the biggest question in their mind is if they really need to go and spend an hour at Walmart or Giant for that.

Grocery War at Its Height

While Amazon is clearing thinking big and taking bold steps, the likes of Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General too are going the online way, thus creating a perfect setup for an intense war in the groceries space. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. While Walmart, the country's largest grocer is leaving no stone unturned to tap this area by offering customers the option to order online and a free pick-up from the store, Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm.

However, Amazon seems to be playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing. The company will pull items from Whole Foods stores, bag them but get the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two-hours. That certainly is a big challenge for those that are trying to go the online way.

More in Store

Understandably, there is a lot more that can be expected from retail giants in the near future. Walmart has already entered into a partnership with Japan's Rakuten to sell e-books in the United States and strengthen its online grocery business in the Asian nation. Amazon's move may have just ignited a fierce competition that's only going to flare up. However, the others too seem very much in the race.","Customers in Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach can now order fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items that their local Whole Foods stores stock.

98,"Aug 23, 2018",MarketWatch,Opinion: These 7 little-known health-care ETFs are up 20%-plus in 2018,"While technology stocks tend to make the flashiest headlines, the health-care sector remains one of the most consistent outperformers.

The top health-care exchange traded fund (ETF) by assets, the $18 billion Health Care Select SPDR ETF XLV, +0.02% , has gained about 10% this year vs. 6% for the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.15% . And longer term, it’s up about 205% in 10 years vs. about 145% for the S&P 500.

The flagship XLV fund is not alone, either. The No. 2 health-care-oriented ETF by assets, the $9 billion iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, -1.70% , is up about 7% this year to slightly outperform the broader market, but has done even better in the long term; the shares are up about 330% over 10 years.

It’s no surprise, then, that investors closely follow these health-care funds and continue to invest plenty of funds in the leaders. However, there is a variety of more tactical ETFs to play in this sector beyond popular health-care or biotechnology funds.

Here are seven top-performing health-care ETFs that have trounced the S&P 500 in 2018, and have doubled the 10% return of the popular XLV fund.

Janus Henderson Obesity ETF

2018 performance: 20% vs. 6% for the S&P 500

There are plenty of complex mega-trends in health care, including the demographic shift that is resulting in a growing population of older Americans needing more services as well as a favorable regulatory environment that is streamlining research into “orphan drugs” to target diseases with few effective treatments. Then there’s the broader and much simpler health issue of overweight Americans, with nearly four in 10 Americans categorized as obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

The Janus Henderson Obesity ETF US:SLIM is a way to profit from this trend, with holdings that include diabetes-treatment company Novo Nordisk NVO, -0.14% and dialysis provider DaVita DVA, +0.59% as well as weight loss and nutrition plays like Herbalife HLF, +2.17% and Medifast MED, +0.69% . In an age of obesity, investors can fatten their wallet with targeted plays like this on that trend.

iShares U.S. medical-devices ETF

2018 performance: 20% vs. 6% for the S&P 500

While drugmakers get a lot of attention, either via Big Pharma stocks that offer dividends or small-cap biotechs that offer impressive growth potential, many investors overlook the boring medical-products companies that deliver the tubes, pumps and tools that are necessary to make medical facilities function.

The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF IHI, +0.38% offers a way to play this corner of health care, however, with top holdings that include health-care products giants such as Medtronic MDT, +1.56% , Baxter International BAX, +1.07% and Edwards Lifesciences EW, -0.82% . While some of the products offered by these companies are indeed high-tech, such as artificial heart valves, many are less glamorous, such as catheters and blood-pressure cuffs. But despite their flash, these items are staples, and medical offices and hospitals nationwide remain big revenue sources for these companies.

iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF

2018 performance: 22% vs. 6% for the S&P 500

A focused way to play the business of health-care insurance is via the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF IHF, +0.05% . Top holdings in this fund include UnitedHealth Group UNH, +0.43% , CVS Health CVS, -0.93% , Anthem ANTM, +0.84% and Aetna US:AET, to name a few.

Like it or lump it, the U.S. has a for-profit system of care and the current leadership in Washington is intent on keeping it that way. And when you bake in less regulatory red tape and bigger tax cuts for domestic health-care companies, it all adds up to a pretty nice uptrend for insurance companies in 2018.

It’s also worth noting that a higher interest rate environment could help insurance companies that comprise the bulk of the health-care providers ETF, since they reinvest the “float” of premiums in low-risk, interest-bearing assets.

Invesco DWA Healthcare Momentum ETF

2018 performance: 23% vs. 6% for the S&P 500

The Invesco DWA Healthcare Momentum ETF PTH, +0.03% is a potentially volatile play, since it relies on fast-moving picks, but one that has been able to deliver big rewards in 2018 despite a bit of increased risk. This fund layers in qualitative metrics such as relative strength and momentum data in addition to simply slicing up the market based on a sector or industry theme as many funds do.

The result is a targeted list of about 50 common stocks, consisting mostly of health-care equipment and biopharmaceutical companies listed on the Nasdaq. That includes fast-growing remote health-care service provider Teledoc Health TDOC, -0.08% , which has more than doubled since Jan. 1.

The fund is rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly to reflect the latest trends, too, to avoid riding winners too long after the momentum rolls over.

Ark Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF

2018 performance: 23% vs. 6% for the S&P 500

Another health-care play with an elevated risk profile is the Ark Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF ARKG, +0.19% . This fund harnesses the appeal of biotechs, offering a chance to tap into amazing gains if and when research into new treatment bears fruit, but with a unique focus on genetic-related businesses. This includes health-care names that use gene editing or bioinformatics in their business.

At present, the fund holds a concentrated list of 37 picks including Intellia Therapeutics NTLA, -0.07% and Illumina ILMN, -2.66% as the top holdings, which are up 33% and 48%, respectively, since Jan. 1.

If you’re interested in biotech but find funds like the iShares IBB biotech fund too focused on bigger companies, the ARKG fund might be for you, as it has a more development-stage feel.

SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF

2018 performance: 27% vs. 6% for the S&P 500

A mix of established names as well as smaller and more specialized players, the SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF XHE, +0.70% is a powerful way to play the tailwind in the health-care sector but carve out some of the muddier consumer health or insurance-related plays in many large-cap funds. There’s also less product pipeline risks, such as patent expirations for Big Pharma or risky clinical trials for cash-burning development-stage biotechs.

Holdings include more popular stocks such as robotic surgery firm Intuitive Surgical ISRG, +1.54% and large-cap Abbott Laboratories ABT, -0.78% as well as niche investments like Tandem Diabetes Care TNDM, +1.51% .

This play is in many ways related to the aforementioned iShares IHI fund; however, it is not quite as top-heavy, with the largest position representing less than 4% of the portfolio and the list of holdings focused on smaller companies in general.

Invesco S&P SmallCap Health Care

100,"Jan 22, 2018",MarketWatch,Opinion: How to find companies that will benefit most from the Trump tax cuts,"The Republican-led tax cut has been an amazing gift to investors.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs think 2018 S&P 500 earnings will grow 14%, with more than a third of that coming from tax reform. That’s in the process of getting priced in to stock prices, and it helps explain the market’s strength so far this year.

Since tax reform passed, “much of the rally has been analysts doing forecasts for 2018 and adjusting the tax rate,” says Charles Mulford, an accounting professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who runs the Georgia Tech Financial Analysis Lab.

There’s good reason for the rally. Theoretically, at least, the market value of a company should increase by the dollar amount of tax saved multiplied by the company’s price-to-earnings ratio, says Albert Meyer, a money manager at Bastiat Capital, which is up 177% since its April 2006 inception compared with 104% for the S&P 500 SPX, +1.15% .

This is another way of saying that as earnings increase by the amount of tax saved, either the P/E ratio has to go down or the stock price has to go up. This won’t always be the case, but it is a good rule of thumb.

Let’s take Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.49% as an example. The retailer paid $4.3 billion in 2016 taxes at an effective tax rate of 36%. At 21%, Home Depot would have paid $2.5 billion, saving $1.8 billion. Multiply Home Depot’s P/E of 27 by that $1.8 billion in extra earnings, and you get a $48.6 billion increase in market capitalization. That boosts Home Depot’s value to $282 billion from $233 billion, a 21% increase in the value of the company, and presumably its stock, though some of this is undoubtedly priced in already.

Here are four basic rules to follow if you want to hunt for tax cut beneficiaries on your own — to avoid the pitfalls and get the most traction. I’ve also included a few dozen companies that appear to be some of the biggest potential beneficiaries. Special thanks to S&P Global Market Intelligence for assistance with screening databases to come up with the numbers to do this.

Rule No. 1: Check the effective tax rates

The rallying cry for corporate tax cuts was that U.S. business taxes were among the highest in the world. This was only a half-truth. The dirty little secret among U.S. companies is that, because clever tax lawyers exploit a raft of deductions, many companies pay no tax at all. Or at least rates well below the current 21%. Obviously, they aren’t going to benefit from a tax cut to 21% from 35%. Big picture, the effective tax rate for the S&P 500 was 26% last year, far below the 35% tax rate at the time, notes Abby Cohen of Goldman Sachs.

A lot of companies pay no taxes because they make no money. Obviously, you can scratch them off your list of tax-cut beneficiaries. Many of those are in energy and biotechnology, including Hess Corp. HES, +3.88% , Halliburton Co. HAL, +3.05% , ConocoPhillips COP, +3.44% , Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. ALNY, +2.05% and Juno Therapeutics Inc. US:JUNO. Early-stage companies like Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.03% are in the same boat.

But even companies reporting lots of net income can have low tax rates. They’re not going to benefit from lower tax rates. These include Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +2.14% GOOG, +2.40% , with an effective tax rate of 19.3%, Facebook Inc. FB, +1.07% (18.4%) and Boeing Co. BA, +2.76% (12.1%).

In contrast, companies with lots of net income and also effective tax rates well above the new 21% level include: Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.31% , with an effective tax rate of 31.4%, Walt Disney Co. DIS, +4.04% (32%), Comcast (CMCSA) CMCSA, +2.29% (37%), Fastenal FAST, +0.14% (36.8%), Dollar General Corp. DG, -1.38% (36%) and American Express Co. AXP, +3.83% (33%). You can find the effective tax rate in a company’s annual 10-K report.

Rule No. 2: Go domestic

Companies that pay all or most of their tax abroad won’t benefit from the U.S. tax cut. So take those off your tax-boost shopping list. Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.23% has a relatively high effective rate of around 30%. But it’s all on foreign profits. The same goes for Philip Morris International Inc. PM, +1.36% . Aflac Inc. AFL, +1.55% pays a large percentage of its tax abroad, so it fits the bill, too.

In contrast, companies that do stand to benefit because they have tax rates well above 21% on mostly domestic profits, while they report little to no foreign taxes, include: CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.93% with a tax rate of 38.4%, United Parcel Service Inc. UPS, -0.33% (33%), Lowe’s Cos. LOW, +0.41% (40.5%), TJX Cos. TJX, +0.95% (38%), Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, +5.68% (36.7%), Altria Group Inc. MO, +0.75% (34.8%), Aetna Inc. US:AET, Visa Inc. V, +3.46% (42.7%), Campbell Soup Co. CPB, -0.67% (31.4%), Comcast (37%), Capital One Financial Corp. COF, +2.82% (31.3%) and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.54% (35.2%).

Rule No. 3: Avoid companies with high debt

They’re not going to benefit as much from the tax cuts, because the new rules limit deductions for interest paid. Companies can only deduct interest expenses of up to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This will take a sizable bite out of earnings. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the change will raise about $171 billion in tax revenue over 10 years. Further restrictions on interest deductions starting in 2022 will raise another $307 billion over 10 years.

Companies with high tax rates that have a lot of debt include: J.C. Penney Co. US:JCP, Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, +4.62% , Eastman Kodak Co. KODK, +2.20% , Ford Motor Co. F, , Pitney Bowes Inc. PBI, +4.44% , Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. SBGI, +2.24% , Sequential Brands Group Inc. US:SQBG and Townsquare Media Inc. TSQ, -1.53% .

Rule No. 4: Go small

The sweet spot for companies getting a boost from the tax cut are small- and mid-cap companies, which I’ll define as businesses with a market cap of between $500 million and $5 billion. There are two reasons why. First, they typically can’t afford the army of tax lawyers hired by large-cap companies. So they tend to pay higher taxes. Next, those companies are less researched and noticed by others. So any benefit from the tax cut may be less priced in.

To find some of the better potential winners here, I cut out any names that are losing money or don’t pay taxes. Next, I avoided the ones with high debt, and those paying a substantial amount of tax to foreign countries. I also avoided names that look expensive either on a P/E or price-to-book basis.

Names that look like big winners under the tax cut because they clear all these hurdles and pay high effective tax rates include: Evercore Inc. EVR, +3.30% , with a tax rate of 44.5%, MYR Group Inc.

Companies excluded as direct beneficiaries of the tax cut still stand to gain. Presumably, the companies that do benefit will invest some of their newfound cash flow, creating economic growth.

The dirty little secret among U.S. companies is that, because clever tax lawyers exploit a raft of deductions, many companies pay no tax at all.
Big picture, the effective tax rate for the S&P 500 was 26% last year, far below the 35% tax rate at the time, notes Abby Cohen of Goldman Sachs.
You can find the effective tax rate in a company’s annual 10-K report.

108,"Aug 23, 2018",Money Morning,This Healthcare Stock Will Make a Killing off the Health Revolution,"It may not seem like it, but the healthcare sector has been one of the biggest profit generators during this bull market's historic run. And that could continue, as one healthcare stock we're watching could change the game...

On Wednesday (Aug. 22), the current bull market became the longest in U.S. history.

Since March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 alone has risen more than 300%. But if you look deeper into the numbers behind the S&P's growth, you find that one industry has outpaced all the others.

The S&P 500's healthcare stock sector, which is comprised of the largest health insurers , is up more than 1,100% since 2009.

In addition to strong economic growth, legislation like the Affordable Healthcare Act and the expansion of Medicaid created a wave of profit opportunities for the healthcare sector.

They've also created monster gains for healthcare investors.

As the bull market closes in on its tenth year, the healthcare industry is pursuing several massive mergers in an effort to maximize its profitability.

And the massive profit trend health insurers are tapping into right now could net you an easy 100% gain over the next 18 months - and even more over the next decade...

The Merger Movement Is Your Ticket to Profits

Stronger economic growth, lower taxes, higher profits, and competitive pressures have driven mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare space over the last few years.

However, the U.S. government has largely opposed the consolidation of health insurance companies.

A Federal judge struck down a proposed merger between Aetna Inc. (NYSE: AET) and Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) in 2017. And Anthem Inc. (NYSE: ANTM) abandoned its plans to merge with Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI) during the same year.

Billions Are Now in Play: Millions of Americans could collect ""Federal Rent Checks"" - to learn how to claim your portion of an $11.1 billion money pool using this backdoor investment, click here now...

Because the U.S. government has denied mergers between the biggest insurers, other healthcare firms are eyeing them as lucrative acquisitions.

Last year, CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS), one of the world's top pharmacy benefits managers, announced plans to merge with health insurance giant Aetna Inc. in a deal worth $70 billion.

As Money Morning Special Situation Strategist Tim Melvin explained, the trend of deals between health insurance companies and benefits managers is ""transformational... and a potential goldmine.""

You see, the combination of a health insurance company and a benefits management company is an entirely different approach to providing healthcare.

CVS has more than 10,000 combined retail and MinuteClinic walk-in locations. By working with a health insurance giant's ""Big Data"" capabilities, CVS now ensures its community health centers deliver faster, better care on a more cost-efficient basis.

Not only can CVS and Aetna more effectively provide services, they can also deliver managed care around the customers' schedule. This is a game-changing - and perhaps even life-saving - trend for millions of Americans.

This business model is likely to sweep across the healthcare industry and revolutionize it in the process.

But one company is taking it a step further, and it could revolutionize the entire sector.

Plus, our propriety stock rating system says it's a perfect buy right now...

109,"Nov 30, 2018",ConsumerAffairs.com,News for November 2018,"Who would have guessed that an app designed to order massages straight to your door had both poor security and customers with perhaps some trouble keeping their hands to themselves?

Urban, a popular London-based startup selling “wellness that comes to you,” accidentally leaked its entire customer database online, revealing email addresses, phone numbers, and names of all its 309,000 customers. Included in the database were also complaints from therapists about the specific clients who requested “sexual services.”

Urban pulled the database offline after the website TechCrunch discovered it and contacted the company for comment. So there’s probably no need to go into hiding if you’re one of the offending customers, unless someone took a screenshot.

House hunter

A dentist in Missouri is out $90,000 after hackers successfully impersonated the real estate companies that he was already doing business with.

Howard Ritchey Jr. was hunting for a new home last year and working with title, mortgage, and real estate companies to make the purchase happen. In the middle of the deal, he received an email from what looked like his title company which instructed him to wire $88,338 over to secure his desired house.

But when he followed up in person with his lender, he was told the money didn’t go to the home. The lender said it looked like hackers got into his email and stole his money. Ritchey is now suing the title company and other parties, alleging that hackers actually targeted their emails and failed to warn him about the impersonators.

Ritchey’s case isn’t unique; the FBI says that similar complaints of real estate business impersonators are on the rise. Yet another reason not to wire money.

Dunkin’ Donuts

Joining a donut loyalty program may have seemed like the ideal way to make your troubles go away, but reality isn’t so sweet. Dunkin’ Donuts recently informed holders of its loyalty Perks accounts that they should change their passwords to all of their other, non-donut-related accounts because their Dunkin’ Donuts passwords may have been stolen.

Dunkin’ says that thieves tried to break into the loyalty program and may have gained access to consumers’ usernames and passwords in the process. Consumers are instructed to change their passwords to other accounts only if its the same password they used for the Perks program.

Dell

Every single person who has shopped for Dell online had their password reset in the online store and wasn’t told why. The computer chain initially discovered it was hacked back on November 9 and changed passwords five days later.

A source familiar with the incident says that Dell never informed consumers of the breach before changing their passwords on their behalf, according to a report published Wednesday in Reuters.

Security experts say it's shameful on Dell’s part that consumers were never told why their passwords were automatically reset, explaining that the move leaves potential victims “abandoned in the darkness and ambiguity.”

Amazon

Consumers and researchers are scratching their head about a vague notice that shoppers received from Amazon shortly before Black Friday. The message says that users had their data exposed due to a “technical error,” but it does not specify much else, such as what type of data was exposed or how many people were affected.

Asked for more details, Amazon has told reporters that there is “nothing to add beyond our statement.” Amazon also told users they already fixed the unspecified issue and that there is no need for consumers to do anything. So, do with that information what you will.

Health records, again

Healthcare hackers have struck again, this time targeting more than two million patients covered by Atrium, a North Carolina-based provider.

The firm said an “unauthorized third party” accessed patient information between Sept. 22 and 29, but the company told patients that medical records and payment information remains safe.","House hunterA dentist in Missouri is out $90,000 after hackers successfully impersonated the real estate companies that he was already doing business with.

1,"Mar 8, 2018",Investopedia,What's Behind Cigna's $67B Express Scripts Buy?,"Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) plans to make waves in the health care space may have just been narrowed by another major deal inked between a health insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). On Thursday, Cigna Corp. (CI) announced its acquisition of Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX) in a blockbuster $67 billion deal, which will be paid with $52 billion in cash and the rest in debt. (See also: Tax Cuts Prompt Biggest Merger Spree in Decades.)

E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon said earlier this year that it was teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) to take on America's broken health care space with an independent company that seeks to offer services to the firms' employees at a lower cost. Upon the announcement, $30 billion in collective market value was wiped from the 10 largest publicly traded health insurance and pharmacy stocks in the U.S.

Shares of Express Scripts have surged over 10% as of Thursday afternoon on the deal, which some on the Street see as spelling equally bad news for Amazon. Many had speculated that Express Scripts, a PBM that negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans employers, could play a role in the joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. The deal also takes the option for Amazon to buy Cigna off the table, according to Leerink Partners senior health care services analyst Ana Gupte, as reported by CNBC. If the company ever wanted to get into the health insurance industry, a Cigna takeover would have made sense for the tech titan, according to Gupte.

Narrowing Options

""It is possible that the threat of an Amazon entry into the healthcare and possibly the drug supply chain landscape, with the latest news of the Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway-J.P. Morgan employer coalition, has spurred Cigna and Express Scripts to tie the knot,"" said the Leerink analyst in the CNBC report.

Amazon and its new venture may have to act fast before all of the best targets are gobbled up and the industry is run by a few major players. Pharmacy retailer and PBM CVS Health Corp. (CVS) in December announced it would buy insurance giant Aetna Inc. (AET) while Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) is reported to be circling drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC). Plus, Amazon will also want to avoid overpaying, given valuations are only getting bigger, as Cigna will dole out nearly nine times Express Scripts 2017 EBITDA for the 32-year-old company. Given current market conditions, if Amazon is serious about its health care push, it might just decide to go all out with a mega-deal, such as a $100 billion bid for Walgreens.

2,"Mar 7, 2018",Reuters,Health insurer Cigna to buy Express Scripts for about $52 billion,"(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp CI.N struck a $52-billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O on Thursday, looking for new ways to hold onto their profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs.

The pharmacy benefits business, which tries to negotiate down the price of prescription medicines for large employers, has drawn fire from the Trump administration and Congress, who have questioned whether those discounts are really being passed on to consumers.

Cigna's deal follows close on the heels of a rival $69-billion merger between CVS Health Corp CVS.N and health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N, announced in December. Together, the transactions would represent a massive consolidation of the market for managing employees' prescription drug benefits, prompting some experts to question whether they will be approved.

""Employers are growing increasingly frustrated with the cost of prescription drugs and a lack of transparency into the economics of how this works,"" said Jim Winkler, senior vice president for health at benefits manager and broker Aon, part of Aon Plc AON.N.

Cigna and Express Scripts say the combination will lower costs for corporate clients by giving them more coordination between medical care and pharmacy benefits, particularly for pricey specialty drugs.

“Our employer clients will be delighted with that,” Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview.

It could help Cigna more closely manage how costly drugs are prescribed and delivered to patients, and fend off potential competition from new players such as Amazon.com.

All told, the companies project $600 million in annual savings.

Express Scripts shares were up 8 percent at $79.29 on Thursday afternoon, but they were trading 12.6 percent below the current value of the bid, suggesting that some investors see difficulties closing the deal.

Cigna shares fell 11.5 percent to $171.86.

DEALS IN TANDEM

PBMs administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims.

The largest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group UNH.N, in 2015 expanded its in-house pharmacy benefits business, OptumRx, with the $13-billion purchase of Catamaran. CVS, Express Scripts and UnitedHealth control more than two-thirds of the PBM market, a top U.S. health official said on Wednesday.

Anthem Inc ANTM.N in October said it would expand its own pharmacy benefits business, and hired CVS to do so.

Antitrust experts said the Trump administration would need to review how both deals between Cigna and Express and between CVS and Aetna would affect the U.S. market, already the world’s most expensive healthcare system.

“Having two simultaneous deals significantly raises the risk,” said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer with expertise in the health industry. “There’s a significant risk that both deals get challenged.”

In 2016, the Obama administration scuttled two major health insurer mergers - Anthem Inc’s purchase of Cigna and Aetna’s purchase of rival Humana - largely on concerns the consolidation would raise costs for consumers.

Today’s deals between an insurer and PBM represents a so-called vertical integration of players within the health industry. But it could limit the ability of large employers to choose who manages both prescription drug benefits and medical coverage for their employees.

“This type of merger would create a market-straddling giant, with new profit-maximizing incentives ... ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers,” said George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.

Most national companies with more than 20,000 employees use different companies to provide prescription drug benefits and medical coverage. Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said during a conference call with analysts that he does not expect to lose other health insurers who use Express Scripts as their PBM because of the deal.

THE OFFER

Cigna’s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 in shares of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts’ Wednesday closing price.

Cigna will also assume about $15 billion in Express Scripts’ debt, the company said.

The combined company will be led by current Cigna CEO Cordani. Wentworth will stay on as president of the company’s Express Scripts unit.

After the deal closes, expected by the end of the year, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest.

Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The combined company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion.

The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal.

Carl Icahn is reportedly not a fan of Cigna's $67 billion merger with Express Scripts.

Shares of the pharmacy benefits manager fell as much as 8% Wednesday afternoon following a Wall Street Journal report saying billionaire Carl Icahn had amassed a sizable stake in insurer Cigna and plans to vote against its deal with Express Scripts. The Journal reported that his stake in Cigna is less than 5% of the company's outstanding shares.

Shares of Cigna rose about 3.5% on the news.

Cigna, one of the US largest health insurers, announced the deal in March, offering $48.75 per share in cash for Express Scripts in a move aimed to cut soaring healthcare costs. The $54 billion price tag was a 31% premium to Express Scripts' stock price at the time, and includes about $15 billion worth Express Scripts' debt.

In April, the Department of Justice asked for an extension to gather more information from Cigna and Express Scripts. The 30-day waiting period needed for the deal to close will not begin until all the information has been obtained, and that process can take a while.

The deal came just months after the $69 billion healthcare mega-merger between health insurer Aetna and drugstore chain CVS Health. These so-called vertical mergers are creating new combinations that are starting to blur the lines of what constitutes a healthcare company at a time when the companies responsible for paying for healthcare expenses — like insurers — are feeling the effects of new procedures and innovative medications coming into the market with high price tags. To counter that, they've been consolidating, in part hoping that it will give them more of leverage.

6,"Aug 9, 2018",Business Wire,Cigna Reiterates Continued Support for Proposed Merger with Express Scripts,"BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) (“Cigna” or the “Company”) issued the following letter to stockholders in response to the second letter released by Carl C. Icahn about the Company’s proposed merger with Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ: ESRX) (“Express Scripts”).

Dear Cigna Shareholders:

This morning Carl Icahn released a second letter in opposition of our combination with Express Scripts. Given Mr. Icahn continues to spread innuendos and false information about the transaction, our Board of Directors and management team wants to set the record straight once again for our shareholders.

Cigna, over the past 8 years of regulatory and competitive disruption, has a proven track record of delivering outstanding value for clients, customers and shareholders – including 384% cumulative total shareholder returns from December 31, 2009 through June 30, 2018. Our combination with Express Scripts represents a strategically and financially attractive path to continue to drive value for clients and customers in close coordination with our physician partners and, as a result, deliver outstanding value to our shareholders.

Our combination will lower costs and improve quality – a goal around which everyone should be aligned. Cigna has been clear about the expectation that cost improvements from the combination will flow directly to clients and customers, while administrative cost savings will flow to our shareholders – creating value for all stakeholders. We also disagree in the strongest possible terms with Mr. Icahn’s assertions that the failure of the combination would advance the greater good of society. Cigna and Express Scripts have always taken our societal responsibilities extremely seriously, and have provided extensive illustrative materials of the benefits we believe this combination would bring. We have not seen a single compelling piece of evidence advanced by Mr. Icahn to the contrary.

Our combination with Express Scripts will be transformational in the industry by combining two leading health care services companies that together will have the capabilities, financial flexibility, reach and expansion opportunities to create significant and immediate value for clients, customers and shareholders. Specifically, as a combined company we expect to:

Achieve a strategic goal (as previously communicated) to slow the rate of increase of drug and medical spending to a level that is more in line with the average increases of other goods in services in the U.S. (i.e., CPI) by 2021 for the benefit of our clients and customers.

Deliver mid-teens accretion in the first full year after closing and generate greater than $600 million in retained synergies annually - as a result, Cigna has raised its 2021 EPS target to $20 - $21 vs. prior guidance of $18. This does not take into account the additional savings that we will be able to generate for the benefit of our clients and customers.

and generate greater than $600 million in retained synergies annually - as a result, Cigna has raised its 2021 EPS target to $20 - $21 vs. prior guidance of $18. This does not take into account the additional savings that we will be able to generate for the benefit of our clients and customers. Generate free cash flow of greater than $6 billion in 2021, allowing for rapid deleveraging and exceptional strategic and financial flexibility in a highly dynamic marketplace.

This is just naming a few of the expected benefits of the combination. All of this will result in a flexible, innovative and strategic platform that has the ability to win in more regulatory and competitive scenarios than either company could ever do on a stand-alone basis.

Turning back to Mr. Icahn, it is clear he has no apparent interest in understanding the underlying logic of our proposed deal with Express Scripts, the current healthcare regulatory environment or the unsustainable rise in drug costs in the U.S. We believe that his last-minute, ill-founded campaign is motivated by a desire to profit off of his stated “substantial short position” in Express Scripts by leveraging his recently acquired 0.56% ownership stake in Cigna, despite the value destruction that would result for other Cigna shareholders.

Mr. Icahn’s letter also misstates numerous facts about Cigna, Express Scripts and the proposed transaction. The facts are:

1. Cigna's Board and Senior Leadership. Mr. Icahn’s unfounded assertion regarding Cigna's Board and senior leadership is false. Our Board and our senior leadership team are and have always been 100% supportive of and committed to our combination with Express Scripts. We remain committed to closing the transaction by year-end 2018. 2. Rebates. Mr. Icahn’s assertion that the value of our combination with Express Scripts will be materially impaired if rebates are eliminated is false. The elimination of rebates does not pose a material threat to the value of our combination with Express Scripts. Additionally on Tuesday, HHS made an announcement that creates even new opportunities for PBM capabilities to be used to improve affordability and outcomes in Medicare Part B. As we disclosed yesterday, rebates are applicable to less than 10% of Express Scripts’ claims and it retains approximately $400 million of rebate dollars on a pre-tax basis. Furthermore, Express Scripts is a pharmacy services company that provides services well beyond PBM services as it:

Employs over 3,000 health care professionals to close gaps in care (e.g., improve adherence and reduce waste);

Helps those who struggle with complex diseases like cancer, HIV, mental illness and other conditions that require the holistic specialized care model only Express Scripts provides;

Has a specialty pharmacy, Accredo ® , which helps bring together a patient’s pharmacy, medical and home-based services to drive better outcomes;

, which helps bring together a patient’s pharmacy, medical and home-based services to drive better outcomes; Has 10 innovative, industry-leading SafeGuardRx programs to improve care and value for customers through a suite of solutions that target therapy classes that pose clinical challenges for customers and a significant budget threat to their clients (e.g., inflammatory conditions, diabetes);

Redefined patient benefit management through its acquisition of eviCore in 2017, an innovative evidence-based medical benefit management services company that provides, among other things, utilization management services for health plans and employers; and

Saved $32 billion for its clients in 2017 through its costs savings programs, excluding any value derived from rebates and retail discounts.

As a result, there are a number of ways it gets paid for its services – all of which are at the option of the client. Whatever amount Mr. Icahn’s companies are paying to Express Scripts, they are doing so because Express Scripts is delivering value in a variety of ways and Mr. Icahn’s companies are willing to pay for that value. Our physician partners recognize this value as well. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from them that they see our combination with Express Scripts as an opportunity to improve affordability and quality for their patients, who are our customers. 3. Amazon. Mr. Icahn’s assertion that Amazon’s entry into mail order pharmacy is a reason not to pursue a combination with Express Scripts is ill-informed. Amazon recently announced its plans to acquire PillPack, an in-network pharmacy that contracts with pharmacy benefit managers, including Express Scripts, as stated on PillPack’s website. Express Scripts operates the largest mail order pharmacy that dispenses over 330 million adjusted prescriptions annually. It delivers outstanding quality and service results, is part of a clinically integrated set of services and is supported by a number of proprietary patents. We do not view PillPack’s current business model as a direct competitor to PBMs, which offer greater value-add capabilities beyond mail order pharmacy. We see mail order pharmacy as just one of the capabilities that Express Scripts brings to bear and is not where we see the greatest value-add for the combination. When the broad range of capabilities of Express Scripts (including its data and data management tools) are combined with Cigna's health engagement, clinical tools and deep physician partnerships, we will have:

Unrivaled Predictive Capabilities . Over 80 million Americans (roughly 25% of the population) are currently healthy but with a meaningful health risk. Together, Cigna and Express Scripts will have combined medical/pharmacy information for over 100 million customers and flexible technology to share insights from that data in an actionable way - including the ability to predict health and treatment adherence risks. Having the capability to assist individuals to lower health risks that they do not even know exist will improve quality of life and lower costs.

Having the capability to assist individuals to lower health risks that they do not even know exist will improve quality of life and lower costs. Seamless Coordinated Care and Treatment . We will deepen relationships with physicians (through our 500+ collaborative accountable care organizations); pharmacists (through our pharmacy networks); and drug manufacturers (through our supply chain management) and be able to coordinate pharmacy, medical and behavioral healthcare and treatment – even for the most complex cases. Additionally, together we will employ over 7,000 clinical professional, including Accredo’s 500 home infusion nurses, working to improve the health of our over 100 million customers.

Additionally, together we will employ over 7,000 clinical professional, including Accredo’s 500 home infusion nurses, working to improve the health of our over 100 million customers. Aligned Incentives . We will have the tools, information and reach to lead the value-based and outcomes-based reward structure across the healthcare spectrum and will be rewarded based on the value we generate for the benefit of clients and customers. As Cigna has done in the medical arena, the combined company will lead a transition to value based and aligned incentive arrangements in the pharmacy space as well – all with the goal of improving quality and value.

Finally, social responsibility is something that Cigna takes very seriously. In May 2016, we set a goal to reduce the use of prescription opioids among its members by 25% in three years. A full year ahead of its schedule, Cigna recently announced that, working with its physician partners, it has achieved that goal. Now, we have turned our attention to a new challenge. We will collaborate with employers, customers, prescribing clinicians, pharmacists and community-based organizations to reduce the number of opioid overdoses by 25% among our commercial customers by December 2021. The combined company will have more end-to-end insights and information, as well as additional reach to drive further alignment in ways that matter.

Our combination with Express Scripts is much more than the rhetoric and misinformation that Mr. Icahn would have our shareholders believe. It simply cannot be boiled down to rebates or Amazon or any other red herring issue that Mr. Icahn wants to seek to use as a scare tactic to support his own personal agenda.

For these reasons, Cigna's Board and senior leadership continue to believe that the proposed merger with Express Scripts is in the best interest of shareholders and continue to recommend that Cigna shareholders vote “FOR” the Express Scripts transaction.

From a technical standpoint, Cigna stock broke down from key trendline support, the 200-day moving average and both pivot point support levels to lows that haven't been seen since June of last year. The relative strength index (RSI) fell to oversold levels of 21.66, but the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) took a bearish downturn. With the news out of the way, shares are likely to stabilize near $170.00 support levels.

Traders should watch for some consolidation around $170.00 before the stock potentially moves back above S2 support at around $175.06. If the stock breaks down from $170.00, it could move down to the next trendline support level at around $165.00. If the stock rebounds higher, traders should watch for a move to S1 support at around $185.47 or the 200-day moving average at around $188.80 over the coming weeks.

8,"Aug 14, 2018",Reuters,Express Scripts staking out million-dollar gene therapies,"(Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O built a multi-billion enterprise pressuring drug companies to lower their prices for U.S. patients. Now it is quietly building a side business: getting paid to help drug companies dispense a new generation of high-priced drugs.

FILE PHOTO: Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller poses for a portrait in the Manhattan borough of New York January 22, 2015. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo

Express Scripts is in talks with biotechnology companies Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc BMRN.O, Spark Therapeutics Inc ONCE.O and Bluebird Bio Inc BLUE.O to have its specialty pharmaceutical business exclusively distribute their new hemophilia therapies when they are expected to become available in 2019 and 2020, Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller told Reuters in an interview.

Biomarin, Spark and Bluebird confirmed to Reuters that they were speaking to a payers - a group generally defined as pharmacy benefit managers, health plans and government agencies

- about pricing models for future therapies. Analysts project those drugs could top $1 million to $1.5 million in price.

Rather than rail against the drugs’ expected high prices, Miller echoes the familiar drug company argument that the potentially curative therapies will likely be worth the high cost if they supplant the hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual medical costs to treat ailments such as hemophilia, which affects about 20,000 people in the United States alone.

“Even if they charge $1 million, that’s a great deal,” Miller said. “So there are going to be some gene therapies where it is very clear that everyone who has that disease should get it.”

By working closely with biotech companies, Miller says it can help their expensive therapies succeed commercially. To manage any potential conflicts of interest, he said Express Scripts separates its benefits management and specialty pharmacy businesses.

The move into hemophilia builds on exclusive rights Express Scripts already has to distribute Spark's Luxturna - an $850,000 treatment for a rare genetic disorder that, left untreated, causes children to go blind. It has a similar deal with Biogen Inc BIIB.O on Spinraza, he told Reuters. The drug costs $750,000 the first year and treats the rare condition spinal muscular atrophy that often kills babies within months of their birth. Spark and Biogen confirmed the agreements.

The company also helps manage one of the most expensive gene-based cancer treatments on the market: the $475,000 Novartis AG NOVN.S gene-based cancer therapy Kymriah - a personalized treatment that requires a long hospital stay. Novartis confirmed the arrangement to Reuters.

Those deals put Express Scripts in a vastly different role than its traditional business managing prescription drug claims for the employees of its corporate and government clients, a business Cigna Corp CI.N found so valuable that it agreed in March to acquire Express Scripts for $52 billion.

Patients usually know Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) as the name on the insurance card they present at the pharmacy counter when picking up a prescription. That card activates discounts the benefits managers have negotiated with drug companies to lower prices, usually through rebates. PBMs make money by taking a cut of the rebates, and the rest goes to their clients.

Express Scripts, which negotiates the prescription payments for 80 million people in the United States, competes with UnitedHealth Group Inc’s UNH.N Optum and CVS Health Corp CVS.N.

These companies are usually among the most vocal critics of the pharmaceutical industry’s pricing practices, publicly calling out companies and specific products for their high cost.

But the pharmacy benefits businesses themselves are facing growing criticism from U.S. regulators, lawmakers, drugmakers, and President Trump, who say they act as unnecessary middlemen and end up helping drive up prices for payers.

Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn mounted a proxy campaign to stop the deal on expectations the Trump Administration would end the rebates it relies on for profits. But he abandoned his efforts after two shareholder advisory groups came out in favor of the deal.

GROWTH vs CONFLICTS

As the PBM fight plays out publicly, Express Scripts has been expanding its low-profile specialty pharmacy business - which dispenses drugs that usually aren’t sold through drugstores because they require special handling. By using its own pharmacy instead of outsiders, Express Scripts is able to hold onto more of the profits along the drug distribution chain.

Specialty pharmacy is one of Express Script’s fastest growing businesses and accounts for about a third of its sales and profits, ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken said. The company earned $4.1 billion last year on total revenue of more than $100 billion - it does not break out financial information for specialty pharmacy.

Many of the newest, most advanced medicines - including gene-based therapies and personalized cancer treatments - will be dispensed through specialty pharmacies, and Express Scripts is pitching biotech companies for exclusive arrangements.

By working as both the manufacturer’s partner who gets paid for each sale, and the pharmacy benefit manager responsible for negotiating the best price for its traditional corporate and government clients, Express Scripts is open to questions about being conflicted, industry sources and experts say.

“One could view this role as being a wonderfully catalytic: that they can help balance the views and interests of all the parties by being in this middle facilitating role. Or one could view that they have created a situation where internally they have multiple conflicts of interest, and can they manage them properly?” said Mark Trusheim, strategic director of a group of international payers and providers formed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study gene therapy pricing models.

Express Scripts says it saves money for payers on Luxturna by cutting out the hospital pharmacy mark up, which is 6 percent for the government Medicare program and more for commercial business – or at least $60,000 on a $1 million drug.

Miller said the company has a firewall between its specialty pharmacy business, which serves the drugmakers, and its businesses negotiating on behalf of his clients, the payers.

“Our PBM treats our specialty pharmacy as they treat any other pharmacy in our pharmacy network,” he said. “So they are not privy to their acquisition prices or anything else, and the specialty pharmacy is not privy to the contracts that the PBM has with their payer clients or anything else.”

Beyond potential conflict concerns, there is risk in whether the gene therapies will ever make it to the public.

Spark on Aug. 7 said two patients in a small trial had an adverse immune response to an experimental hemophilia gene therapy and its shares lost more than a quarter of their value. And last month, U.S. regulators put Biogen’s gene therapy program for spinal muscular atrophy on hold, but no details were disclosed.","(Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O built a multi-billion enterprise pressuring drug companies to lower their prices for U.S. patients.

Wall Street analysts had expected antitrust approval as the companies have little overlap in their businesses. The decision bodes well for the pending U.S. antitrust review of CVS Health Corp's CVS.N proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.

The new company will marry Cigna's business of managing health plans for corporations and the government with Express Scripts' ESRX.O role handling pharmacy benefits for those same customers. Express Scripts also owns specialty pharmacies that distribute pricey drugs.

“We are pleased that the Department of Justice has cleared our transaction and that we are another step closer to completing our merger,” Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in a statement.

The Justice Department review of CVS’s planned purchase of Aetna may conclude this month, but will take longer because of divestitures needed to resolve competitive concerns, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the company continues to expect to close its deal late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, a forecast it gave investors on Aug. 8 during a conference call.

The Justice Department in 2016 successfully blocked a pair of large health insurance mergers it believed would limit competition in the industry. Those were Aetna's plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurer Humana Inc HUM.N for $37 billion, and a planned $54 billion combination of insurers Anthem Inc ANTM.N and Cigna.

Aetna and Cigna, however, were determined to seek growth through deals while responding to a changing healthcare landscape, eventually targeting mergers with the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).

“We believe these two transactions add more pressure on Humana to move further down the path of vertical integration,” William Blair analyst John Kreger said. “We suspect other health plans will look to follow suit.”

FEELING THE PRESSURE

Antitrust experts have described the current deals as vertical combinations that present fewer issues than the failed insurer mergers. That view was bolstered after the Justice Department lost its case to stop AT&T's T.N acquisition of media company Time Warner. The department is appealing the decision.

“Everyone is feeling the pressure right now ... to react to disruption in the healthcare industry,” said Brad Haller, a director in West Monroe Partners’ mergers & acquisitions practice.

That disruption includes Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O moves into healthcare. The world's largest online retailer purchased online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it undercut traditional prescription drug sales.

Amazon has also aligned itself with JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N to experiment with new business models for employee healthcare - one of Cigna's target markets.

Cigna’s purchase of Express Scripts comes as PBMs’ role in prescription drug costs has come under scrutiny.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said it is looking at how so-called industry middlemen and pharmacies such as Express Scripts and CVS impact drug costs for U.S. consumers. The administration is looking at implementing a rule that could change or eliminate the use of rebates from drugmakers to PBMs that critics say contribute to higher drug prices.

Cigna and Express Scripts said they have already obtained clearances for the deal from departments of insurance in 16 states and are working with regulators in remaining jurisdictions to obtain clearance for the merger.

“States could still conduct a public hearing ... though it is very unlikely that they do not align with the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision,” Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said.

The companies continue to expect the deal to close by the end of the year, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions.

Cigna shares closed up 1.4 percent at $197.84, while Express Scripts shares closed up 3.7 percent at $95.23. CVS and Aetna shares also rose, closing up 1.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.","The decision bodes well for the pending U.S. antitrust review of CVS Health Corp's CVS.N proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.

13,"Apr 22, 2018",The Motley Fool,Better Buy: CVS Health Corporation vs. Express Scripts,"The U.S. healthcare industry is in the middle of an upheaval. Lines between health insurers, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) are becoming increasingly blurred. There are probably no better examples of this than CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).

CVS Health ranks as the largest pharmacy chain and the second-largest PBM in the U.S. In December, the company announced plans to merge with Aetna (NYSE:AET), the No. 3 health insurer in the country. Express Scripts is the biggest PBM. In March, Cigna (NYSE:CI), the fifth-largest health insurer in the U.S., announced that it was acquiring Express Scripts.

Which stock is the better choice for investors now between CVS Health and Express Scripts? It's complicated.

The case for CVS Health

Many investors are skeptical about CVS Health's planned acquisition of Aetna. The deal means that CVS Health will accumulate a lot of additional debt. The company's steady dividend increases of the past few years ground to a halt. There's no guarantee that integration of the two organizations will go smoothly.

However, one of the most significant challenges with the U.S. healthcare system is that it's so fragmented. A combination of a large pharmacy chain, PBM, and health insurer -- in addition to CVS Health's MinuteClinic walk-in clinics that are in many of its pharmacy stores -- could be just what's needed.

CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo thinks the merger with Aetna will enable the resulting entity ""to remake the consumer healthcare experience."" It's quite possible that CVS Health will be able to introduce innovative new products that manage chronic care more effectively once the deal is finalized. That could lead to nice revenue and earnings growth over the long run.

But will the deal actually go through? That remains to be seen. The U.S. Department of Justice is closely scrutinizing the proposed merger of the two companies.

One key reason for investors to consider buying CVS Health is that the stock trades for less than 10 times expected earnings. A combination with Aetna would increase the resulting entity's valuation somewhat, though, since Aetna's share price is currently 14.5 times expected earnings.

And while CVS Health's dividend hikes of the past are at least temporarily on hold, investors should still like the yield of more than 3%. The company should be able to sustain payment of its dividend at current levels even with the assumption of additional debt to fund the Aetna acquisition.

The case for Express Scripts

Why think about buying Express Scripts? For one thing, the stock should move higher if Cigna is allowed to buy the big PBM.

Cigna offered a cash and stock transaction valued at roughly $54 billion plus assumption of Express Scripts' debt of around $15 billion. Express Scripts' current market cap stands around $41 billion. If the deal goes through, investors buying Express Scripts now would see a return of over 30% by the end of 2018.

It's important to note, though, that the market appears to think the acquisition could be blocked by regulators. While Express Scripts jumped immediately following the announcement of a potential buyout by Cigna, shares fell soon afterward. Express Scripts stock price is now close to its level prior to when news broke about the acquisition. Cigna however, said in a statement this week that it is ""optimistic in our ability to obtain regulatory approval.""

Still, investors need to consider the case for Express Scripts if the Cigna deal doesn't happen. The good news for Express Scripts is that it remains the No. 1 PBM in the U.S. at a time when controlling prescription drug costs is as important as ever. As baby boomers age, they are likely to require more prescription drugs, a trend that should benefit Express Scripts.

However, there's also bad news for Express Scripts. The company's revenue declined a little in 2017 compared to the prior year. Earnings were higher year over year, but the increase was primarily due to a larger tax hit in 2016.

The worst news for Express Scripts is that its contract with Anthem expires at the end of 2019 -- and Anthem doesn't intend to renew the agreement. The insurer is Express Scripts' largest customer, contributing 19% of the PBM's total revenue last year. Changing dynamics in the healthcare landscape could make it difficult for Express Scripts to make up for the loss of the Anthem revenue.

Express Scripts stock is cheap right now, with shares trading at a little more than seven times expected earnings. However, that low valuation reflects the challenges that the PBM faces over the next few years.

Better buy

If neither of these two companies' deals actually happen, I think CVS Health is better positioned for the long run. However, if Cigna's acquisition of Express Scripts wins approval by regulators, Express Scripts will enjoy a much bigger boost in its stock price than CVS Health will. On the other hand, if CVS Health's merger with Aetna closes but Cigna doesn't buy Express Scripts, my winner between the two is again CVS Health. Clear as mud, right?

My guess -- and it's only a guess -- is that both deals will secure approval. They're both different scenarios than a combination of two companies in the exact same line of business. If I'm right, Express Scripts is the better stock to buy right now, even though I think CVS Health has the better long-term prospects.

However, I'm not certain the Cigna buyout of Express Scripts will actually go through. As a result, I'm not calling Express Scripts as a stock to buy right now. Like I said earlier, it's complicated.","There are probably no better examples of this than CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).

14,"May 24, 2018",,Companies have spent a stunning $2 trillion on mergers so far this year,"Merger mania is back with a vengeance this year. Companies have announced more than $2 trillion in deals so far in 2018.

That's a record pace for merger activity, topping the deal volume from the first few months of 2007, according to Thomson Reuters. And if this keeps up, merger activity should easily pass the all-time annual record of $4.7 trillion in deals set in 2015.

The acquisitions span the globe -- and various industries.

• Health insurer Cigna (CI) is buying pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts (ESRX) for $67 billion.

• Japan's Takeda (TKPHF) is scooping up rival pharmaceutical company Shire (SHPG) for $62 billion.

• German utility E.On (ENAKF) announced it would purchase green energy company Innogy for $27 billion.

• Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) even finally agreed to a $26 billion merger last month.

• Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is buying fellow refiner Andeavor for $23 billion.

• Vodafone (VOD) is acquiring cable assets of Liberty Global (LBTYA) in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania for about $22 billion.

• And Keurig Green Mountain took over Dr Pepper Snapple for nearly $20 billion.

What's fueling this flurry of mergers?

Big companies have a ton of cash. And many markets around the world remain near record highs despite more volatility in 2018. This combination of healthy balance sheets and strong share prices gives firms the currency they need to pursue acquisitions.

Some experts have argued that the M&A boom is one reason why smaller stocks are outperforming the broader market this year.

Bigger companies recognize that many smaller firms are growing their sales and profits more rapidly, which makes them juicy takeover candidates. And investors seem to be taking bets on who the next M&A candidates might be.

It might not be a bad strategy. According to a recent survey of 400 US CEOs by KPMG, 23% of business leaders said that they expected acquisitions to be one of their key strategies to help boost growth over the next three years.

Whats more, 36% of the CEOs said they had a ""high M&A appetite.""

""M&A is all about optimism and confidence. The level of confidence is still strong,"" said Dan Tiemann, the national service group leader for deal advisory & strategy at KPMG.

""Despite the daily headlines, CEOs are still hopeful and they know they have to keep growing. You have to keep making bets and they have to pay off,"" Tiemann added.

But some fear that protectionist policies in the United States could slow down merger activity, particularly with regards to Chinese and other Asian companies looking at American firms. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has already blocked the purchase of San Diego-based chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) by Singapore's Broadcom (BRCM), for example.

""Technological dominance is likely to be at the center of a new era of intensifying competition between the U.S. and China,"" said Richard Turnill. global chief investment strategist with BlackRock, in a report this week.

Turnill expressed concerns about what might happen if the United States continues to block acquisitions of American tech firms by Chinese companies.

""Such actions may intensify and dampen M&A activity,"" he wrote.","That's a record pace for merger activity, topping the deal volume from the first few months of 2007, according to Thomson Reuters.

16,"May 30, 2017",TheStreet,Behind the War Between Health Insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers,"More competition could help overcome the suspicion over drug prices that plagues the would-be business partners' dealings.

Pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance companies, in theory, should be close partners.

But Anthem's (ANTM) - Get Anthem, Inc. Reportprotracted litigation with its PBM, Express Scripts (ESRX) , and its decision in April not to renew their contract when the current one expires at the end of 2019 shows how fraught the relationship can be.

The job of PBMs is to negotiate lower prices from drug manufacturers and pass the savings on to insurers and patients, keeping a cut for themselves. Whether PBMs are passing on enough of the savings or keeping the biggest shares for themselves is a long-running bone of contention that has created suspicion between them and their insurance company partners and among patients and elected officials worried about high drug prices.

Insurers have struggled to respond to questions surrounding PBM practices. Anthem is trying litigation against Express Scripts. UnitedHealth (UNH) - Get UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Report runs its own standalone PBM, OptumRX. Cigna (CI) - Get Cigna Corporation Report does much of its own drug price negotiation through an in-house PBM.

Because of the uncertainty over where PBMs best fit into the drug distribution chain, the three managers that dominate the PBM business each have a different business model. Express Scripts is the only independent among the Big Three. Optum is part of an insurance company and CVS Health (CVS) - Get CVS Health Corporation Report, the country's largest pharmacy chain, runs CVS Caremark.

The uncertainty has also led to continual consolidation of PBM ownership and speculation that insurers and retailers are trying to expand their presence in the business of negotiating drug prices. Express Scripts has been eyed as a possible takeover candidate after with the eventual loss of Anthem, its top customer. By some estimates, Express Scripts could fetch $60 billion from a buyer like Walgreens (WBA) - Get Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc Report . Walgreens will get to test drive the PBM business if it ever wins federal approval to buy drugstore rival Rite Aid (RAD) - Get Rite Aid Corporation Report , which bought small PBM EnvisionRx in June 2015.

Other big PBM deals in recent years include Express Scripts' $29.1 billion acquisition of Medco Health Solutions Inc.in April 2012.

Going forward, there's talk that Cigna and Anthem may each want to operate their own standalone PBMs.

""It's a very complex industry,"" said Jane Lutz, executive director at the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute. The Big Three CVS, Express Scripts and OptumRX have three-quarters of the market share and their valuation propositions vary along with their approaches to driving drug prices lower also vary.

The process is so baffling to employers that buy insurance for employees that they seek outside help evaluating just the PBM component of their benefits package. Says Lutz, ""90% of employers hire consultants to help them manage that process.""



The opacity of the PBM business, particularly because PBMs don't reveal the prices they negotiate with their drug manufacturers even to their insurance company partners, has led to legislation on Capitol Hill to require more transparency and to activist campaigns at PBMs and drugmakers.

On May 18 Kynikos Associates' James Chanos, famous for his shorting campaign at Enron, argued that shares of Mallinckrodt (MNK) - Get Mallinckrodt Plc Reportwill fall when the government investigates a ""murky"" alliance between Mallinckrodt and Express Scripts. In November the Department of Justice filed charges against former Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) executives for engaging in ""a multi-million dollar fraud and kickback scheme"" involving pharmacy benefit manager Philidor Rx Services.

On the legislative front, little is likely to happen in the Republican-controlled Congress, despite President Trump's campaign pledge to fight for lower drug prices. Interference in what is seen as a marketplace negotiation isn't likely to get much traction with GOP lawmakers. The real action may be with Scott Gottlieb, Trump's appointee to run the Food and Drug Administration, who has called for replacing the current PBM model, in which drug manufacturers compete to be included on insurance company approved lists—dubbed formularies—by offering rebates to the PBMs based on the volume of a drug's sales. Some but not all of that rebate is passed along to insurers. That system encourages drugmakers to push the upfront price as high as possible. Gottlieb has called for negotiation of upfront drug discounts instead and the elimination of the rebate system.

If Gottlieb's suggestion is implemented, ""the role and influence of PBMs in formulary selection would vanish,"" wrote Adam Fein, editor of the blog Drugchannels in a March 14 post.

Insurers aren't waiting to see how the situation in Washington shakes out. To move away from a system that rewards drug makers for the volume of drugs sold, several insurers are experimenting with value-based pricing that pays drugmakers more when their drugs prove effective at lowering costs of treating patient populations, particularly those with chronic conditions like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C and high cholesterol, which account for a huge percentage of health care costs.

Editor's pick: Originally published May 26 at 8 pm ET.

CVS and Express Scripts have negotiated rebates and discounts with manufacturers based on a drug's effectiveness treating a particular indication. According to Leerink analyst David Larsen, Express Scripts has required drugmakers to rebate the company and its insurance company sponsors as much as two-thrids of the cost of a drug if performs unsatisfactorily.

Cigna is trying that approach too and recently received a PBMI excellence award for its program. Lutz said PBMI admired Cigna's efforts because the insurer is integrated with claims processing, its PBM, and a home delivery pharmacy.

""Theoretically a value-based program should reduce the cost of care, but because there's a lag in processing claims and reporting data so it's hard to quantify the results,"" Lutz said. ""What stuck us about Cigna's submission is its ability to look at the total healthcare equation.""

Cigna CEO David Cordani told analysts during the company May 5 earnings call that the insurer has established seven value-based contracts with drugmakers.

Cigna, he said, is trying ""to change the reimbursement model with drug manufacturers from volume to value.""

Andrew Selesnick, a shareholder in Buchalter PC and a lawyer in the firm's litigation and healthcare practices, said insurers might like to but generally can't ditch PBMs. ""Insurers have a love/hate relationship with them,"" he said. ""They need the access to drug manufacturers that PBMs' scale provides.""

Although there's no figures to help insurers gauge how much they really save, PBMs do ""keep costs down in a relative sense,"" Selesnick said. ""If insurers can save 5%, they'll take it.""

In the wake of the federal government's decisions to block the mergers of Anthem with Cigna and Aetna with Humana, he thinks the next round of industry moves could be for insurers to set up their own full service PBMs. ""One thing that could come out of the failed mergers could be the large insurers going into the PBM business."" Selesnick said.

A return to almost half a dozen large PBMs could give the business the scale and negotiating leverage it needs to truly drive down drug prices.

""If the Big Three becomes the Big Five, it could make a difference,"" he said.

17,"Dec 3, 2017",,CVS is buying Aetna in massive deal that could transform health care,"CVS is buying health insurance giant Aetna, the companies announced Sunday.

If approved, the $69 billion acquisition -- $77 billion including debt -- would drastically remap the health care industry. CVS Health (CVS)is a massive drugstore chain and prescription drug insurer, while Aetna (AET) is one of the nation's largest health insurers.

It would also go down as the largest health insurance deal in history, far exceeding Express Scripts (ESRX)' $29 billion acquisition of Medco in 2012, the last record-holder.

The acquisition is not a done deal. It will have to be approved by antitrust regulators, who have been skeptical of similar health care mergers.

Buying Aetna puts CVS in a better position to compete with other integrated health care providers, such as UnitedHealthcare (UNH) and pharmacy benefits manager Optum. PBMs like Optum and CVS's Caremark help manage prescription drug plans for commercial health insurers.

Together, UnitedHealthCare and Optum have already taken business away from CVS, said Ana Gupte, a health care analyst for investment firm Leerink.

Gupte added that Amazon's rumored desire to enter into the pharmacy business could be another motivating factor.

Related: Amazon may be factor behind rumored CVS, Aetna merger

Aetna, meanwhile, hasn't been growing as quickly as its peers, Gupte pointed out. A shakeup could be good for business.

And by teaming up, CVS and Aetna are following broader industry trends, said George Hill, a health care technology & distribution analyst with RBC Capital Markets.

Pharmacies like CVS and health care providers like Aetna are looking for ways to make it cheaper and easier for their clients to access medication and care, he said, because that's what their clients want. Joining forces is an efficient way to do that.

But it's not entirely clear if or how quickly savings would get passed down to consumers. Gupte pointed out that Aetna already has a deal with CVS Caremark, so prescription drug prices may not go down. Customers could see benefits down the road, however, if CVS turns some storefronts into clinics or primary care centers.

Market Sectors: See latest news & which stock market segments are performing best

But advocacy groups have criticized the deal. The Coalition to Protect Patient Choice said that ""mergers like these have a dismal history,"" adding, ""consumers suffer by paying more and getting less choice for the vital drugs they need.""

The prospects for the deal are uncertain, since mergers involving health insurance companies have recently run into regulatory roadblocks. In 2015, Aetna and Humana (HUM) announced a $34 billion merger, while Anthem (ANTX) agreed to acquire Cigna (CI) for $54 billion. Both deals were called off in February after they were blocked by federal judges citing antitrust concerns.

At a recent sell-side event, “management highlighted the company was focused on a new strategy for the stores, but would not share any details on the strategy for competitive reasons,” said Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes, describing it as “strange” and “a bit puzzling.”

The company suggested that more details might be available in the next year, she said.

Of course, there’s no guarantee that big-ticket mergers elsewhere will be successful. Many are seemingly motivated by industry-wide consolidation, or describe vague, if lofty, goals.

This suggests a goal of becoming a health-care hub, said Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen, though “few details were provided around the results that these new stores are seeing, the costs of the store investments, and what exactly changed in those locations.”

Moreover, Walgreens doesn’t plan to add more clinics or urgent-care centers, so “it is unclear to us how WBA will truly transform the way in which care is delivered in their local communities,” Larsen said.

A “store of the future” that transforms consumer health also sounds a lot like the CVS-Aetna CVS, -0.93% US:AET deal’s ambitions.

But unlike its rivals, Walgreens can get the benefits of vertical integration without its massive costs, through partnerships, Chief Executive Stefano Pessina told analysts, Larsen said.

20,"Jun 28, 2018",,Amazon buys online pharmacy PillPack,"Amazon is buying online pharmacy PillPack — a move that could disrupt the drug store business.

PillPack has pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. The company delivers medications to customers in pre-sorted doses designed to make it easier for people to take multiple medications a day.

Amazon (AMZN) was widely expected to move into the pharmacy business.

And Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, is creating a health care company along with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA).

The PillPack deal is already scaring investors in the top two drug store chains.

CVS (CVS) fell 9% in early trading. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest Dow component, plunged more than 10%. Walgreens was already trading lower after reporting a drop in same-store sales at its US pharmacies.

Related: Amazon is already trying to disrupt health care

Rite Aid (RAD) shares also fell, as did the stocks of big drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC).

These and other health care stocks rose a few months ago after reports that Amazon may not have been interested in selling prescription drugs. So much for that.

It's not clear yet just what Amazon plans for PillPack. Will it eventually merge it into a broader health care platform on Amazon or keep it independent as it has done with other subsidiaries like shoe retailer Zappos and video site Twitch?

The fact that PillPack is already licensed to sell prescriptions may persuade Amazon to keep it independent.

But all the companies said on Thursday was the deal was subject to some regulatory approvals and that the companies hope to close the transaction during the second half of this year.

Walgreens doesn't seem too worried.

During the company's earnings call Thursday morning, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in response to a question about the PillPack deal that the pharmacy business is ""much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages.""

Pessina added that physical pharmacies ""will continue to be very, very important in the future.""

The PillPack acquisition comes just a week after CVS announced it will start delivering prescriptions to people's homes — a response to growing competition from PillPack and Capsule, another online pharmacy startup.

The health care industry is also in the midst of merger mania. CVS is buying insurer Aetna for while Cigna (CI), another insurer, is scooping up pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX). Both deals are valued at nearly $70 billion.

Those deals were announced after two mega insurer mergers were blocked by federal judges early last year on antitrust grounds. Aetna had hoped to combine with rival Humana (HUM) while Cigna was planning to merge with Anthem (ANTM).","Amazon is buying online pharmacy PillPack — a move that could disrupt the drug store business.

23,"Jun 18, 2018",,Comcast will become one of the world's most indebted companies if it buys Fox,"Comcast is on the verge of maxing out its credit card to win 21st Century Fox FOXA

If it wins the bidding war with Disney, the cable giant will take on as much as $85 billion of debt. That would be a dramatic shift for a company long known for a conservative balance sheet.

And that doesn't include the $27.5 billion of debt that Moody's estimates would come with a successful takeover of the British satellite broadcaster Sky.

All told, Comcast's spending spree would nearly triple its total debt to $170 billion, according to the Moody's ratings firm. Not counting banks, that would make Comcast the world's second-most indebted company by dollars, behind the newly combined AT&T and Time Warner, according to Moody's.

""It's an unprecedented amount of debt for a company like Comcast,"" said Cowen analyst Gregory Williams.

Comcast's aggressive strategy shows how badly CEO Brian Roberts, a longtime rival of Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger, wants 21st Century Fox's film studio and cable networks. The two are bitter enemies, dating back more than a decade to when Comcast attempted a hostile takeover of Disney.

Comcast is confident that it can generate enough cash to pay down the debt. AT&T has described its purchase of Time Warner in similar terms.

But Comcast risks borrowing too heavily to buy media assets as it adapts to an industry upended by Netflix (NFLX)-inspired cord-cutting. Comcast has just $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet, meaning it will have to borrow most of the $65 billion cash that it bid for Fox. If it's successful, Comcast would also take on Fox's $20 billion of debt.

Related: Which media companies are still up for grabs?

'Bit of a surprise'

Moody's warned in a report last week that it may downgrade Comcast's credit rating if Comcast pulls off the bid for 21st Century Fox.

Comcast's leverage would spike. Moody's estimates that, if it acquires both Sky and 21st Century Fox, Comcast's debt will soar from about 2.5 times its annual profit to about 4.25 times.

Among high-debt companies, and again excluding banks and government-related entities, only AT&T (T) and beer giant Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) would have higher leverage ratios, Moody's said.

Even some on Wall Street were taken aback by the shift from Comcast.

""The willingness to take your leverage up to this level is a bit of a surprise,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne said during a Comcast conference call after it announced the Fox bid.

He asked Roberts to explain how he and the board ""got comfortable"" with taking on so much debt. Roberts played down the worries and predicted that Comcast will grow fast enough to swiftly clean up its balance sheet.

""We're having an excellent quarter, and we've had an excellent run for several years,"" Roberts said. ""We're confident enough in the company and our prospects that we can take a temporary re-leveraging and bring us back down.""

Comcast did not respond to a request for comment about the Moody's report.

It's a complicated time to pile on debt.

Borrowing costs have risen sharply, making it more expensive to refinance debt as it comes due. And some worry that the economic expansion, already the second-longest on record, could stumble over the next few years.

""If there's a recession,"" Williams said, ""investors will flock away from levered companies.""

Will Disney lever up?

Some analysts on Wall Street share Roberts' optimism. Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research called the Comcast proposal ""manageable.""

""We can debate the growth prospects of the cable industry, but the business from a free cash flow standpoint is going to generate robust cash flow for years to come,"" he said. ""This is going to deliver very, very rapidly.""

Instead, he questioned how much Disney would be prepared to borrow as part of a counter offer.

""What's Disney's willingness to lever up?,"" he added. ""I've covered Disney for 23 years. They've never really levered up. Are they prepared to?""

Disney's original $52.4 billion bid for Fox was all stock. Other analysts expect the company may add cash as part of a counter.

Disney declined to comment. The company has not yet spoken publicly about Comcast's bid.

Other analysts are more skeptical of the Comcast offer, especially considering how much money Comcast will need to spend on content to keep up with Netflix and other rivals.

Ultimately, it will be ""challenging"" for Comcast to get borrowing back to healthy levels without selling assets or cutting its stock dividend, Moody's said.

Corporate America is racking up serious debt

Comcast is hardly the only company taking on debt to scoop up rivals.

In fact, Moody's downgraded AT&T's credit rating two notches on Friday following the completion of its $85 billion purchase of CNN owner Time Warner. The deal will leave AT&T with more than $180 billion of debt, according to Moody's — an amount the ratings firm said makes it ""beholden"" to the whims of the capital markets.

Asked about the downgrade, an AT&T spokesperson said the company's debt ratings and balance sheet ""are among the best in the industry,"" adding that the company sees the merger as ""a very positive move for us.""

AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson acknowledged the amount of debt during an interview on CNBC last Friday. But he also said the company will generate enough cash to pay it down.

""This thing delivers quickly,"" he told the network. ""Within four years, we'll be back to our normal levels of debt.""

UBS estimates that AT&T will generate around $12 billion next year in excess free cash flow, which the firm says would probably be used to pay down debt.

If Comcast successfully buys Fox and Sky, it should have between $10 billion and $15 billion per year to pay down debt, UBS estimates.

Cigna (CI) is paying for its $67 billion takeover of Express Scripts (ESRX) with cash and debt. If the merger of Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) is completed, those two companies would have as much as $77 billion of debt.

All that debt has drawn the attention of the Federal Reserve. Asked whether the United States is in a ""credit bubble,"" Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that officials are ""watching"" elevated levels of corporate leverage.","Not counting banks, that would make Comcast the world's second-most indebted company by dollars, behind the newly combined AT&T and Time Warner, according to Moody's.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news on Friday.

Swedish will continue to receive his current salary as executive chairman and be eligible for a prorated bonus and as an adviser, he will be paid $4.5 million per year.

Swedish's move comes at a time of change for Anthem, the No. 2 U.S. health insurer. The company cut Obamacare individual market participation by 70 percent for next year and recently announced plans to bring its pharmacy benefit management in house. It also may face a much larger Aetna Inc AET.N, which is considering a deal with CVS Health Corp CVS.N, according to sources.

Boudreaux was most recently CEO of United Healthcare, a unit of the biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N. Before that, she was an executive at the next largest operator of Blue Cross Blue Shield licensed insurers, Health Care Services Corp, and at Aetna.

BMO Markets analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note that Boudreaux is held in high regard by investors but that Anthem’s stock is still a “market-perform” given the company’s slower-growth business mix.

“We expect there may be a period of uncertainty among investors until the reasons for the reported leadership change are understood and fully accepted by the market,” he wrote.

Boudreaux, who will take on the role of CEO on Nov. 20, will receive an annual salary of $1.4 million with a potential bonus of up to 350 percent of her salary, along with an initial stock grant worth $2 million. Long-term incentives are worth up to $10.25 million.

Swedish orchestrated Anthem's $54 billion deal for smaller rival Cigna Corp CI.N in 2015, which was ultimately scrapped as regulators said that and Aetna's proposed acquisition of Humana Inc HUM.N would be anti-competitive.

Two weeks ago, news broke that Aetna and CVS were in talks over a deal that would create a combined health insurance, pharmacy benefit management, and pharmacy company. The deal is expected in December, Reuters reported.

30,"Jun 14, 2018",Nasdaq,Medical Device Industry Outlook - June 2018,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.

Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry's global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.

A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.

Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.

Here are a few major developments:

Abolition of MedTech Tax

The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.

The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.

The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.

M&A Uptrend Continues

Apart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.

Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company's (BDX) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) buyout of Actelion.

PBM-Health Insurers Consolidation

Lately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.

Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.

In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp's (CVS) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.

Digital Revolution and MedTech

Latest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.

Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.

This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.

Trade War Fears Grip MedTech

The 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors' radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.

Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq , MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.

Zacks Industry Rank

Within the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments , Medical - Products , Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems .

33,"Mar 16, 2018",,Evaluating the Managed Care Implications of Longer-Acting Basal Insulin Analog Therapies,"Meanwhile, a meta-analysis of those 7 trials found that patients treated with insulin degludec achieved similar or significantly better fasting blood glucose (FBG) and rates of hypoglycemia than those treated with glargine, even with lower mean total insulin doses. These results held across subgroups of patients with T1D, T2D who were insulin-naïve, and T2D who received basal—bolus therapy. 17

The 7 trials comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine demonstrated noninferiority in A1C reductions. Rates of confirmed hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia, were either similar with the 2 insulins or significantly lower with insulin degludec. 12,18-23

Patients with T2D had a baseline A1C of 7% to 10%, while those with T1D had a baseline of 10% or less. The trials excluded those with a history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia (more than 1 severe episode in the past 12 months) and allowed concomitant oral antidiabetic treatments. A severe hypoglycemic episode was defined as a symptomatic event that requires assistance from another individual to resolve the episode.

Three trials evaluated insulin degludec against insulin glargine in basal—bolus therapy in T1D and T2D, and 4 against glargine in basal–oral therapy in participants with T2D, for a total of 7 trials. 12,18-25 A basal—oral trial in patients with T2D compared insulin degludec with sitagliptin, while another in patients with T1D compared it with insulin detemir. 24,26

Insulin degludec was evaluated in the BEGIN clinical trial program and an interim analysis of DEVOTE, which studied its cardiovascular (CV) safety. The BEGIN program was a series of nine 26- to 52-week, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, treat-to-target trials in patients with T1D and T2D from more than 40 countries. 12,18-24 Table 1 provides an overview of the trials. 12,18-25

Insulin degludec is an ultra—long-acting, once-daily insulin pen approved for use in adults, adolescents, and children with diabetes. 16 Insulin degludec’s stable pharmacokinetic profile stems from the formation of multihexamers upon injection, resulting in a subcutaneous depot of insulin. This delays insulin absorption into the systemic circulation, while the insulin also binds to circulating albumin, resulting in a lengthened duration of action of more than 42 hours and a half-life of approximately 25 hours. Insulin degludec’s concentration does not vary once it reaches a steady-state concentration within 3 days of injection. In addition, its pharmacokinetics are similar even in individuals with renal and hepatic impairment, regardless of the degree of impairment. 8 At the same time, this reduces glycemic variability, thus minimizing hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions. 17

This article highlights the efficacy and safety of insulins degludec and glargine U-300, as well as the combination insulin degludec/liraglutide U-100/3.6 mg/mL and glargine/lixisenatide U-100/33 mcg/mL, and discusses the managed care implications of these newer insulin formulations.

The longer-acting basal insulins degludec and glargine U-300 require a once-daily injection, have a longer and more stable pharmacokinetic profile, exhibit lower within-subject variability, do not result in significant weight gain, and carry a lower risk of hypoglycemia. There is also less involvement with the hepatic or renal systems, and they can be combined with fast-acting insulin or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a single injection. 8,11 This improved clinical profile is leading diabetes experts to recommend the use of basal insulin much earlier in the disease state, with the addition of a GLP-1 RA (either separately or in a fixed dose) if basal insulin alone is insufficient to control A1C. 14,15

Many of those fears are justified. While basal insulins detemir and glargine, with reduced frequency of injection and glucose monitoring, are usually the first option used when initiating insulin therapy, they have numerous limitations, including the risks of hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia, and weight gain; inter- and intra-individual variability; and the potential for twice-daily injections. 9-13

As the first part of this supplement noted, there are numerous barriers to the early initiation of insulin. These include the strict timing required for insulin injections, patient fear of needles, the risk of hypoglycemia, and weight gain. 5-8

Traditionally, insulin therapy has been reserved as a third- or even fourth-line treatment for diabetes, used when all other options fail. However, given a greater understanding of the benefits of early insulin initiation on beta-cell preservation and reduced microvascular complications, the most recent guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommend earlier initiation for patients with hyperglycemia uncontrolled on other antidiabetic medications. 3

Despite high spending and the availability of effective treatments, control of diabetes in this country remains poor. The most recent government figures show that while glycemic control has improved from 1999 through 2010, nearly half of US adults with diabetes still do not reach an A1C of less than 7%; about 20% do not have an A1C less than 8%. The percentages are even worse for patients on insulin therapy from 2007 to 2010: just 30% reached an A1C of less than 7% and just 64% reached less than 8%. 4

A substantial percentage of diabetes-related healthcare costs are the result of complications from the disease, which includes cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), neuropathy, and diabetic retinopathy. Such complications account for 25% of emergency department visits and 45% of inpatient admissions. 2 Maintaining glycemic control, typically defined as a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) less than 7%, can significantly reduce the risk of these complications. 3

The burden of diabetes can be difficult for patients and complex for the US health system. Direct medical costs for diabetes in 2012 were $176 billion, about $1 out of every $10 spent on healthcare in the United States. 2 Overall medical costs for those with diabetes are, on average, 2 to 3 times higher than for those without the disease, with more than half the cost attributable to the diabetes itself. People with diabetes also have higher rates of hospitalization and longer lengths of stay than those without, accounting for about a quarter of all US hospital inpatient costs. In addition, the cost of medications has risen substantially in recent years. Today, about a third of what the United States spends on medications can be attributed to diabetes. 2

Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), has become an epidemic in the United States, with a significant portion of patients unable to meet recommended glycemic targets. All individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and a significant majority of those with T2D will ultimately require insulin therapy. However, there are several barriers to its use. The introduction of the new, ultra—long-acting basal insulins degludec and glargine U-300, and the single-injection combinations of insulin degludec/liraglutide and insulin glargine U-100/lixisenatide, offer options that may overcome several of those barriers, including the high risk of hypoglycemia, glycemic variability, and relatively short duration of action. This article spotlights the outcomes of the phase 3 clinical trials for these newer formulations, as well as more recent meta-analyses and real-world studies. It also highlights the implications for managed care plans as they move to add these insulins to their formularies. An estimated 30.3 million people in the United States, or 9.4% of the population, now have diabetes, with about 1 in 4 yet to be diagnosed. The numbers are significantly higher in the 65-years-and-older population, in which 25.2% have the disease. 1

A preplanned analysis of all 7 trials found significantly lower rates of overall confirmed hypoglycemia as well as nocturnal and severe episodes in insulin-naïve patients with T2D who received insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine (estimated rate ratio [RR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.98]; RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48-0.86], and RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03-0.70], respectively).27 Rates of overall confirmed and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemic episodes were significantly lower in the overall T2D population (overall confirmed RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94; nocturnal confirmed RR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.57-0.82), while rates of nocturnal confirmed episodes were lower in the T1D population only during the maintenance treatment period (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.94). Overall reduction in hypoglycemic events in the 3 groups was lowest during the maintenance treatment.27

In the time insulin degludec has been approved, real-world studies have been published and presented. One, EU-TREAT, was a European, multicenter, real-world evidence study investigating the effect of switching to insulin degludec from any other basal insulin (primarily insulin glargine U-100) in people with T1D (n = 1717) and T2D (n = 833). Six months after switching, patients experienced a significant reduction in A1C (—0.2% for T1D and –0.5% for T2D), results that were sustained at 12 months. Rates of overall hypoglycemia were also significantly lower in the 6 months after switching, with the rate of severe hypoglycemia 85% lower in T1D and 92% lower in T2D, with similar results at 12 months. There was also a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in both populations that was maintained over 12 months. In addition, patients were able to significantly reduce their total daily insulin dose (—4.9 units T1D; –2.5 T2D) at 6 months, which remained stable at 12 months.28

The DEVOTE Trial

The CV safety of insulin degludec was evaluated in DEVOTE, a double-blind, treat-to-target, event-driven outcomes trial. The trial enrolled 7637 patients with T2D (85.2% had established CVD, CKD, or both) who were randomized to receive either insulin degludec U-100 or insulin glargine U-100 once daily between dinner and bedtime. The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of a major CV event (death from CV causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was severe hypoglycemia.29

The primary outcome occurred in 8% (325) of patients in the insulin degludec group and 9.3% (356) in the insulin glargine group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78-1.06; P <.001 for noninferiority). At 24 months, the A1C was 7.5 ± 1.2% in each group, with a significantly lower mean fasting plasma glucose level in the insulin degludec group than in the insulin glargine group (128 ± 56 vs 136 ± 57 mg/dL; P <.001). The insulin degludec group experienced 40% fewer episodes of severe hypoglycemia compared with the insulin glargine group (RR, 0.60; P <.001 for superiority; odds ratio [OR], 0.73; P <.001 for superiority) with no difference in rates of other adverse events.29

Insulin Glargine U-300

Insulin glargine U-300 is another long-acting basal insulin analog pen. While it has the same molecule and metabolism as insulin glargine U-100, it delivers the same amount of insulin in just a third of the volume required. This reduced surface area results in a more prolonged and constant release of insulin into the bloodstream, with a steady state reached within 3 to 4 days of daily administration and a half-life of 19 hours. Insulin glargine U-100, in contrast, reaches a steady state after 2 to 4 days of once-daily administration and has a half-life of 12 hours. When converting from U-100 to U-300, the same number of insulin units can be used. However, when switching from U-300 to U-100, it is recommended to reduce the insulin unit by 20%.30,31

Insulin glargine U-300 was evaluated in the EDITION trials, a series of 6 international, randomized, open-label, active-control, treat-to-target, noninferiority phase 3a studies comparing insulin glargine U-300 with insulin glargine U-100. The studies included 792 participants with T1D and 2737 with T2D. The duration was 6 months, with a planned 6-month extension phase.32-38 Table 2 provides an overview of the trials.32

A patient-level meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine U-300 in the EDITION 1, 2, and 3 trials (conducted in patients with T2D) found A1C reductions werebetter sustained over 12 months in the insulin glargine U-300 group than in those receiving insulin glargine U-100 (—0.10%; 95% CI, –0.18 to –0.02; P = .0174). There was also a significantly lower rate of nocturnal or severe hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine U-300 group (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99), although there was no significant difference in the annualized rate of confirmed or severe hypoglycemia at any time of day.39

A real-world, observational study found significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia with similar blood glucose control in patients with T2D who switched from another basal insulin (including insulin glargine U-100, insulin detemir, and insulin degludec U-100) to insulin glargine U-300. After 6 months, patients who switched experienced 33% fewer hypoglycemic events (event rate per 100 patient-months: 7.98 vs 5.32, respectively; P <.01) versus those who switched to other basal insulins, with no impact on A1C.40

A similar study in patients 65 years and older found those switching to insulin glargine U-300 were 57% less likely to experience hypoglycemia at 6 months (OR, 0.432; 95% CI, 0.307-0.607; P <.0001) than those who switched to another basal insulin (insulin glargine U-100, insulin detemir, or insulin degludec). There were no significant differences with glycemic control.41

The results of the TAKE CONTROL trial, a 24-week, open-label, 1:1 ratio, randomized, controlled, 2-arm, parallel-group, multicenter, multinational study, were announced in September 2017. They showed greater A1C control with no increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients taking insulin glargine U-300 with a simple dose, patient-driven titration compared with those whose dose titration was physician-driven.42 Nearly 68% of patients in the self-managed titration group reached the predefined blood glucose target without experiencing severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemia, compared with 58.4% in the physician-driven titration group (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30; P = .0187). Comparable proportions of patients in both groups (6.4% vs 6.3%), experienced at least 1 severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemic event. Full results will be presented in 2018.42

Combination Products

The 2018 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommends combination injectable therapy with a GLP-1 RA for patients with T2D receiving basal insulin who continue to have an uncontrolled A1C, despite an acceptable FPG or daily dose of basal insulin exceeding 0.5 units/kg. The addition of a GLP-1 RA is an alternative to adding a rapid-acting insulin injection or changing to twice-daily premixed insulin.3

The individual pharmacologic actions of basal insulin and GLP-1 RAs complement each other. Basal insulin helps control fasting glucose, but it has limited effects on postprandial hyperglycemia. GLP-1 RAs decrease postprandial glucose excursions by inhibiting glucagon secretion and suppressing appetite, delaying gastric emptying. GLP-1 RAs also have an extremely low risk of hypoglycemia.14,43 Having a medication that addresses fasting and postprandial glucose is a useful tool for controlling a patient’s diabetes.

Administering separate injections each day for a basal insulin and a once- or twice-daily GLP-1 RA requires 2 or 3 daily injections, which may be perceived as a significant barrier.44 In late 2016, the FDA approved 2 fixed-dose basal insulin/GLP-1 RAs: insulin glargine U-100/lixisenatide (insulin glargine 100 units/mL and lixisenatide 33 mcg/mL) and insulin degludec/liraglutide (insulin degludec 100 units/mL and liraglutide 3.6 mg/mL).45

Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide

Insulin degludec/liraglutide was evaluated in the 12-week DUAL I and DUAL II studies. The former compared the combination to monotherapy with insulin degludec or liraglutide in 1663 adults; the latter compared the combination to insulin degludec alone titrated to a maximum of 50 units in 413 adults. Primary end points included reductions in A1C and FPG, proportion of patients achieving A1C less than 7%, and proportion of patients reaching the A1C target without hypoglycemia and/or weight gain.46,47

An analysis of the 2 trials found that patients receiving the combination had a lower mean A1C overall, with a greater percentage reaching target at weeks 8 and 12. At week 12, in a combination of degludec U-100 and liraglutide versus degludec U-100, the estimated A1C change was —0.53% (95 %CI, –0.63 to –0.44). Additionally at week 12, in a combination of degludec U-100 and liraglutide versus liraglutide, the estimated A1C change was –0.43% (CI, –0.53 to –0.33). A higher percentage of patients in the combination group also reached their target A1C without hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia plus weight gain versus insulin degludec alone, but not versus liraglutide alone. Mean FPG was also lower in the combination group, with a higher proportion achieving their target FPG in weeks 4 to 12 than participants in any of the monotherapy groups. Finally, there was a lower mean weight gain from weeks 4 to 12 in the combination group versus the other groups. At week 12, patients taking the combination of degludec U-100 and liraglutide versus degludec U-100 had an estimated weight difference of –1.41 kg (95% CI, –1.72 to –1.10). Additionally, at week 12, patients taking the combination of degludec U-100 and liraglutide versus liraglutide had an estimated weight difference of 1.73 kg (95% CI, 1.42-2.04). Hypoglycemia occurred infrequently in all groups.48

Insulin Glargine/Lixisenatide

The safety and efficacy of insulin glargine/lixisenatide U-100/33 mcg/mL was evaluated in more than 1900 people with T2D during two 30-week clinical studies: LixiLan-L and LixiLan-O. LixiLan-L was an insulin intensification trial comparing the fixed combination to insulin glargine U-100 in a population with a mean baseline A1C of 8.1%. LixiLan-O compared the fixed combination to once-daily insulin U-100 or once-daily lixisenatide in a population with a mean baseline A1C of 8.5%.49,50

In LixiLan-L, 55% of participants receiving the combination obtained an A1C of less than 7% at 30 weeks compared with 30% of those receiving insulin glargine alone. Both groups experienced similar rates of hypoglycemia, with the most frequently reported adverse event in the combination group being nausea (10.4%). Overall, 2.7% (n = 10) of participants in the combination group discontinued due to adverse events (4 were due to nausea). In the insulin glargine group, 0.8% (n = 3) discontinued due to unreported adverse events (AEs).49

In the LixiLan-O trial, 74% of participants reached a target A1C of less than 7% with the combination compared with 59% on insulin glargine alone and 33% on lixisenatide alone (P <.0001 for all). AEs were similar to those seen in LixiLan-L, with similar rates of severe hypoglycemia.50

Novel Insulins and Managed Care

The cost of insulin has increased exponentially in recent years. One study reported a 3-fold increase between 2002 and 2013. Insulin costs increased from $231.48 per member per year (PMPY) (95% CI, $190.40-$272.55) in 2002 to $736.09 PMPY (95% CI, $639.72-$832.47) in 2013, even as the cost of other diabetes-related medications stayed flat or fell (Figure).51

In 2016, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Prime Therapeutics released a study showing a 50% increased use of insulin by its members and an 80% increase in the cost of insulin between 2011 and June 2015. Insulin, the study found, now accounted for $1 of every $20 paid for all drugs in the pharmacy benefit.52 Another PBM, Express Scripts, reported spending $77.50 PMPY in 2015 on diabetes drugs compared with the second highest spending category, pain/inflammation, at $40.65 PMPY. The increase was primarily driven by the cost of insulins.53

While still expensive, the pricing difference between the new and old generation basal insulins is minimal, thus improving their utility.3 Table 3 depicts the average wholesale price and national average drug acquisition cost of the new basal insulins and combinations.3

Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Degludec U-100

One model assessed the budget impact of switching from insulin glargine 100 to insulin degludec in all US commercially insured patients with T1D and T2D on basal—bolus therapy and patients with T2D on basal–oral therapy. The study found an annual cost savings of $357.13 per patient per year (PPPY) for those with T1D, a reduction driven primarily by reduced insulin usage.54 The study found a cost increase of $1420 PPPY among patients with T2D on basal—bolus therapy, driven by the higher dose of insulin degludec required.54 A cost savings of $1206.61 PPPY among patients with T2D on basal—oral therapy was driven primarily by reductions in the cost of treating severe hypoglycemic episodes.

Overall, insulin degludec demonstrated cost savings of $240 million per year, or 3.5%, compared with insulin glargine U-100. However, as the authors noted, the study was based only on a model and may not translate into real-world savings.54

Several cost-effectiveness studies conducted in Europe, where the products have been available longer, have been published. A prospective, real-world, observational study of 476 patients in Sweden who switched to insulin degludec from other basal insulins (nearly all analogs) found life expectancy gains and lower estimated direct lifetime healthcare costs of SEK 22,757 (US$2841). This resulted in the dominance of insulin degludec in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).55

Meanwhile, a cost-effectiveness analysis of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine U-100 conducted in the United Kingdom found insulin degludec more cost-effective in patients with T1D and T2D on a basal-only regimen and in patients with T2D on a basal—bolus regimen. The lower costs in the population with T1D were driven by the lower dose of insulin degludec required, while fewer hypoglycemic events drove the lower cost in patients with T2D. All 3 groups experienced an improvement in clinical outcomes, resulting from the reduced incidence of hypoglycemic events.56

A scenario analysis comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine U-300 also demonstrated the dominance of insulin degludec in patients with T1D and T2D basal-only therapy, with annual per-patient costs £53.36 (US$74.70) lower in T1D, and £52.12 (US$72.97) lower in T2D. The cost difference was driven primarily by the lower insulin degludec dose required for patients with T2D on basal—bolus. The ICER per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with insulin degludec versus insulin glargine U-300 was estimated at £17,918 (US$25,084), even without considering any hypoglycemia benefit (Table 4).56

Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Glargine U-300

A cost-utility evaluation of insulin glargine U-300 versus insulin glargine U-100 in patients with T2D from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System found insulin glargine U-300 with an ICER of €5294 (US$6510) per QALY, making it cost-effective given the €30,000 (US$36,891) per QALY threshold for Spain (typically $50,000 for the United States). The cost-effectiveness was driven by lower hypoglycemia rates and dosing flexibility.57

Cost-Effectiveness of Combination Therapies

An analysis from the Swedish Institute for Health Economics used a 40-year time frame and a societal perspective to assess the cost-effectiveness of the combination insulin degludec/liraglutide pen compared with 6 potential intensification treatment options for patients with T2D whose conditions remained uncontrolled on basal insulin alone. The analysis found that the combination was cost-effective at SEK 70,000 (US$8740)-per-QALY. It had an ICER against intensified basal insulin of SEK 28,000 (US$3496) per QALY; SEK 70,000 (US$8740) per QALY versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin; and SEK 60,000 (US$7491) per QALY versus NPH insulin plus liraglutide. Differences in A1C reductions due to efficacy and response over time drove the results.58

Another analysis, this one from the United Kingdom, reached similar conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of the insulin degludec/liraglutide combination. This analysis found that the combination was more effective and less costly than basal insulin (U-100 insulin glargine or insulin detemir) plus liraglutide, and basal—bolus therapy (U-100 glargine and insulin aspart). Additionally, it was concluded that the combination was highly cost-effective compared with up-titrated insulin glargine U-100, with an ICER of £6090 (US$8525) per QALY gained.59

Payer Considerations

The lower doses required of the insulin and GLP-1 RA combinations versus individual administration, and the improved adverse event profile of either used alone, should be considered in any cost/benefit analysis, managed care experts note.53 While there are published studies evaluating adherence, the ability to move from 2 to 1 daily with combination injections is expected to have a positive impact.53

The cost of insulin affects not just payers, but also patients, given the high percentage of Americans now covered by high-deductible plans. About half of commercially insured Americans today have a single-person deductible of at least $1000, and a third have deductibles of at least $2000.60 Thus, they may pay a considerable portion of their insulin before first-dollar pharmacy coverage begins. Indeed, the media has begun reporting on the challenges patients face in paying for insulin.61,62

When evaluating the newer insulins for formulary placement, payers should consider multiple factors: safety, efficacy, cost, and existing formulation options. Newer insulin therapies will also provide opportunities to track adherence and outcomes. As with many chronic disease states, adherence will be essential to ensure promising outcomes for patients. Thus, once-daily combination products, as well as flexible insulin dosing, will encourage compliance for these products. Another factor that payers must consider is patient population. Diabetes is prevalent, and insulin and GLP-1 RAs are recommended earlier in patient therapy, thus usage of these medications will increase.53

Conclusions

As noted in the first part of this supplement, there are numerous patient and provider barriers to the use of insulin, despite national recommendations to begin insulin earlier in the disease state. The approach to patients with diabetes should take patient-specific factors into consideration, as a one-size-fits-all approach is not supported within the guidelines.

Insulin degludec and insulin glargine U-300, with their more stable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles, flexible dosing, reduced risk of hypoglycemia, and lower likelihood of weight gain, may help overcome those barriers. The availability of single-injection insulin/GLP-1 RAs offers another option to clinicians seeking to individualize diabetes treatment for their patients and improve adherence as well as clinical outcomes. Ensuring that these new options are financially accessible to patients requires that plans carefully evaluate the economic considerations, taking into account the cost of complications related to poor glycemic control.Author affiliation: Dr Daisy is a community-based PGY-1 resident, St. Louis College of Pharmacy/L&S Pharmacy, Charleston, MO.

35,"Jul 16, 2017",,Managed Care Decision Makers: Understanding the Full Scope of Rheumatoid Arthritis Management,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease that affects an estimated 0.5% to 1% of the US population, or approximately 1.5 million individuals. The disease exerts a tremendous toll on patient health-related quality of life, driving many patients out of the workforce as their pain, fatigue, and disability grow. Additionally, with direct medical costs estimated at $22.3 billion and indirect and intangible costs of another $50.1 billion, RA also places a significant economic burden on patients, employers, and payers. The advent of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the past 15 years has revolutionized the treatment of RA, slowing progression of the disease and reducing disability. However, the benefits have come with a huge financial cost, as many of these treatments exceed $20,000 a year. These drug prices have risen by double digits in the past 3 years alone.

Managed care organizations and other payers are implementing numerous approaches to address the challenge of managing the cost of care for patients with RA while improving outcomes. These include utilization review, controlling site-of-care services, shifting coverage of intravenous specialty drugs from the medical to the pharmacy benefit, improving provider adherence to national and international guidelines, and addressing comorbidities in patients with RA. This challenge will become even greater in the next decade with the introduction of new specialty drugs and the growing incidence of the disease.

Am J Manag Care. 2016;22:-S0

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic, progressive disease, is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in the United States. In addition to other factors, the increasing costs of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are putting increasing pressure on payers to identify opportunities to control costs while providing quality care and improved outcomes.

Burden of Disease

RA exerts a tremendous toll on patients and their families. A study of patient self-reported quality of life found that those with RA were 40% more likely to report fair or poor general health than those without RA. The results also revealed that patients with RA are 30% more likely to need help with personal care and twice as likely to have a health-related activity limitation.1 Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is also significantly lower in this population, primarily due to pain, fatigue, disability, and the inability to work.2 About 20% of patients stop working full time in the first year after receiving their diagnosis, and within 15 years, half have dropped out of the full-time workforce.3 However, early, aggressive treatment of RA may reduce work-related disability and keep individuals with the disease in the workplace.4

Economic Burden of Disease

An analysis of direct medical costs in RA, using government data from 2004 to 2006, estimated per patient annual costs in the first 3 years after diagnosis of $4422, $2902, and $1882, respectively, while a 2005 analysis estimated overall annual medical costs of $22.3 billion.5,6 Meanwhile, a study published in 2011, which used data from between 1999 and 2007 from a large employer database that assessed total healthcare costs in patients receiving a single anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drug or switching from an anti-TNF drug, estimated annual costs of $20,370 and $23,388, respectively.7 In 2010, Birnbaum et al estimated annual excess healthcare costs of RA at $8.4 billion.8 The disease is responsible for approximately 9100 hospitalizations a year, at an annual cost of $374 million, as well as 2.9 million ambulatory care visits—65.5% of which are to specialists, such as rheumatologists.6

Furthermore, RA strikes the working-age population; therefore, indirect costs are very important. An estimated $252 million per year are costs attributed to just absenteeism.9 A 2005 study estimated the annual cost of earnings losses, environmental adaptations in the home and work environments, disability payments, decreased productivity, and the cost of retraining replacement workers at $10.9 billion. Intangible costs, including premature death and declines in HRQoL added another $39.2 billion.8 Direct medical costs in these patients are twice as high as those without comorbidities.10

Analysis of an insurance-claims database of 2700 employees with RA and 338,000 without RA found the mean annual cost for workers with RA was $8700 compared with $3500 for those without the condition, costing employers an additional $5.8 billion a year. Direct healthcare costs accounted for 90% of the extra $5200; the rest was related to absenteeism and short-term disability.11

Comorbidities in RA

The prevalence of comorbidities is higher in patients with RA than in those without RA; however, these comorbidities are underrecognized and undertreated.12 Patients with RA have an average of 2 comorbidities, and most are related to the chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction of the disease while some are related to the treatment itself. The most common comorbidities in 1 large study were hypertension (31.5%), osteoporosis (17.6%), osteoarthritis (15.5%), and hyperlipidemia (14.2%).13

Rising Cost of Specialty Drugs

Today, the majority of the economic burden related to RA comes from the use of biologic DMARDs, which are more than 5 times as expensive as traditional DMARDs, such as methotrexate.14,15 One Spanish study revealed that the cost of treating RA tripled between 2000 and 2005 as a result of biologics.16 An analysis of specialty drug costs in a Midwest healthcare plan’s medical and pharmacy administrative claims data between 2008 and 2010 found annual specialty drugs costs consumed 53% of the $34,163 per person annual costs. From 2008 to 2010, annual growth in the cost of care for patients with RA was 8.0%, 5.6% of which was related to drug cost growth.14 The price of specialty drugs has skyrocketed since that time. For instance, the price of etanercept has increased 80.3% since 2013, and today, it costs more than $4000 a month. Adalimumab costs nearly the same, representing a 70% price increase over the past 3 years, while the cost of tofacitinib rose 44.3% to more than $3100 a month.17

Overall, the Alliance of Community Health Plans estimates that the annual cost of treating RA in the United States with DMARDs will increase almost 50% from 2013 to 2020, reaching more than $9 billion a year.17 Although most manufacturers offer coupons and discounts to help patients meet their out-of-pocket costs, they are limited to commercially insured populations. Therefore, while coupons and discounts are not available to patients with RA who have Medicare, an estimated 1 in 4 patients with RA on Medicare receive a biologic DMARD.18 The burden is particularly heavy on this population because Medicare does not cap out-of-pocket expenses as most commercial plans do.19,20 Many coupons also have annual or even monthly maximums.21 Finally, whereas coupons may save patients money in the short term, they do not reduce the actual cost of the drug to the payer. The coupons can also lead to higher costs by encouraging patients to use higher-cost drugs because they do not have to pay any co-payment.22

Cost-Effectiveness of Biologics

Even before the recent increase in biologic drug prices, the National Institutes of Health and similar agencies in other countries identified the cost-effectiveness of these medicines as one of the “highest-priority research topics in the pharmacologic treatment of RA.”23 As a result, dozens of studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of biologics for RA have been published. Such studies are quite heterogeneous, using different willingness-to-pay thresholds (eg, $50,000 or $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gain), perspectives (payer or societal), costs of drugs studied, severity of disease state, outcomes, intensities of treatment, and comparators, making it difficult to determine which drugs are most cost-effective overall.23-35 One systematic review of 18 economic evaluations of biologic monotherapies or combination therapies (eg, adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab) compared the cost with conventional DMARDs. The authors determined that biologics were not cost-effective in patients with no previous DMARD exposure or those who failed methotrexate combination therapy or sequential DMARD administration. They used a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gain. Some evidence of cost-effectiveness was observed at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gain, although the results were mixed.23 It is important to note that most studies were conducted using costs far lower than today’s prices.

Managed Care Strategies

Payers have little control over the price of biologics. Therefore, managed care organizations must adopt a rational approach to weigh the direct and indirect costs of RA to make informed decisions regarding costs and benefits. Part of that approach involves addressing the overall costs of the disease and identifying opportunities to reduce costs while maintaining quality. Potential approaches are described below.

Follow Guideline-Recommended Care

Current guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommend beginning DMARDs in patients with symptomatic RA, regardless of disease activity level.36 Meanwhile, international guidelines highlight the importance of treating to target (T2T), with clinical remission, defined as the absence of signs and symptoms of significant inflammatory disease activity, identified as the primary target for treatment. Until the treatment target is met, drug therapy should be adjusted every 3 months.37

Compared with symptomatic treatment, T2T in early RA is cost-effective. An analysis of 2 years of data, in the DREAM (Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring) registry, from 261 patients who received a T2T approach to care and 213 who received usual care found that T2T was associated with higher costs and significantly higher effectiveness. At 3 years, there was a 64% chance that the T2T strategy would result in lower costs with continued higher effectiveness.38

Patients are more likely to receive such guideline-recommended care when seen by a rheumatologist. An analysis of 27 studies published between 2002 and 2012 determined that DMARD use among patients followed by rheumatologists ranged from 77% to 98% compared with 39% to 63% among those seen by other types of physicians (mainly primary care).39 Given the growing shortage of rheumatologists in this country and the increasing number of people with joint-related and autoimmune diseases, this is an important point.40,41

Initiate Early Treatment

Much of the joint damage inherent in RA begins early in the disease. At 2 years after diagnosis, more than 80% of patients demonstrate signs of space narrowing on radiographs of the hands and wrists, and two-thirds show erosions.42 A very early window of opportunity exists within the first 12 weeks of the disease during which DMARDs may lead to better outcomes than later treatment, including the prevention of erosions and even complete remission.43,44 Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to slowing the progression and degree of disability in RA.45-47

Several studies found significant gaps in patients receiving early treatment, primarily related to the length of time between disease symptom occurrence, referral to a rheumatologist, and DMARD initiation.48 One study revealed that just one-third of patients with RA were assessed less than 12 weeks after their symptoms began, with a median of 13 weeks before they saw a rheumatologist. Patients who saw a rheumatologist within 12 weeks of symptom onset demonstrated a lower rate of progression over 6 years than those whose initial rheumatology visit was delayed (P = .001).47

Treatment with DMARDs not only improves patient outcomes, but can be cost-effective.32,46,49,50 In the United Kingdom’s TICORA (TIght COntrol for Rheumatoid Arthritis) trial, a single-blind, randomized, controlled study conducted in 2 teaching hospitals, 111 patients were randomized to intensive management or usual care. The intervention group was seen monthly and assessed using a validated disease activity score. The usual care group was seen every 3 months with no formal composite measure of disease activity used in clinical decision making.49 More DMARDs were started in the intensive group and fewer were stopped because of toxic effects, with more treatment episodes continuing beyond the trial end. They had a mean reduction in disease activity score of 3.5 versus 1.9 in the usual care group (P <.0001), and were more likely to have a good response or reach remission. Total costs were lower in the intensive group as a result of lower inpatient costs, although outpatient and drug-related costs were higher.49

Assess Appropriate Use of Biologics

The effectiveness of biologic DMARDs is limited. Between 20% and 50% of adults and adolescents treated with TNF inhibitors fail to achieve a 20% improvement in ACR criteria (the current definition of responsiveness) with these agents.51 There is also limited benefit to dose escalations of TNF inhibitors.24

One analysis of 5474 patients with RA receiving a biologic DMARD found that, depending on the drug used, the first-line treatments used were effective in 19.0% to 32.7% of patients.24 In addition, between 10% and 50% of patients eventually stopped responding to the drug they were taking, requiring additional therapy, dose escalation, switching to a different drug within the same therapeutic class, or switching to a drug within another class.52-54

A survey of 100 rheumatologists determined that about half (48%) of their patients cycled through at least 2 biologics during the course of their disease, and 43% cycled through 3 biologics.55 Existing guidelines are vague on when and how to switch DMARDs, resulting in significant heterogeneity in the management of patients with RA.29 While current guidelines call for maintaining the target throughout the course of the disease, this does not imply continuing treatment. However, several studies demonstrate the clinical appropriateness of dose reduction and interval increases, and in some instances, the withdrawal of the use of biologics.56-60

Managed care organizations could use the data within their pharmacy and administrative databases to assess the appropriate use of biologic DMARDs in terms of frequency of switching and the length of trial.

Utilization Review and Benefit Design

Utilization review may improve the appropriate use of DMARDs. A 2011 online survey of 100 rheumatologists and 50 health plans covering more than 80 million lives found that payers used tier placement, prior authorization, and contracting as coverage strategies for RA biologics.55 For instance:

Step therapy. More than half of all managed care organizations used step therapy, in which a patient has to fail a first-line medication before moving onto other options. Although there are no published studies assessing its effectiveness in RA, a review of such approaches for antidepressants, antihypertensives, antipsychotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and proton pump inhibitors found significant drug cost savings for all except antipsychotics. 61

Injectable versus infusion. Biologic treatment with a self-injectable option versus an infused option is less costly to payers. 25 In 2014, about 1 in 4 plans preferred self-administered drugs over those that are provider administered. Eighty-three percent of plans in 1 survey contracted for rebates with the former compared with 57% for the latter. 62

Prior authorization. An analysis of 2737 Medicare Part D plan formularies determined that 97% tightly controlled the use of biologic DMARDs through prior authorization approval. 63 In 2014, approximately 90% of payers required prior authorization for all immune modulator therapies, with 70% creating coverage guidelines across the pharmacy and medical benefits. 62

Optimize point-of-care location. The cost of infusions provided in outpatient hospital settings is up to 40% higher than infusions provided in a physician office. However, in the past 5 years, a substantial percentage of infusions has shifted to the more expensive setting. 64 A 2014 survey of 70 health plans found that 31% had site-of-service strategies in 2013, while 43% planned to implement them in 2014. 62

Limiting supplies. Just 13% of health plans surveyed in 2014 allowed a 90-day supply for patients in remission.62

Shifting coverage of infused specialty drugs from the medical to the pharmacy benefit offers another option for cost management. With this approach, drugs typically come from a specialty pharmacy at negotiated rates versus the buy-and-bill approach, in which physicians or hospitals purchase the drug and are reimbursed an administration fee (and have an incentive to prescribe higher-cost drugs). Obtaining drugs through a specialty pharmacy also provides tighter prior authorization and other cost-management strategies.65 In 2013, 27% of plans put infused specialty drugs for RA under the pharmacy benefit compared with 19% in 2011.66

Maximize Adherence

Nonadherence to medical therapy is an ongoing problem in RA.67-69

A recent analysis of a commercially insured population determined an average adherence rate of 45.7% among 5 biologics, with intravenous biologics demonstrating the lowest rate.25 A review of 2 years of medical records of 75 patients with early RA found that after 3 years, only 34% of patients were still adherent with their medication. Adherent patients had lower Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) values and greater DAS28 improvements, were more likely to reach sustained remission, and had lower Health Assessment Questionnaire scores.68 Patients who were nonadherent were 4 times more likely to experience disease flares than those who followed the recommended protocol.69 Although there are numerous reasons for nonadherence to synthetic and biologic DMARDs, one barrier is cost70,71: one study revealed that 10.5% to 26.4% of patients were nonadherent with TNF inhibitors if their out-of-pocket expenses were more than $100 compared with 4.7% when the co-payment was less.71

Another study found an overall abandonment rate for biologics of 18.2%. Patients with co-payments up to $250 had the lowest rate (1.3%), while those with co-payments greater than $550 had an abandonment rate of 32.7% (P <.0001).72 Out-of-pocket costs also influence whether patients will even start therapy with a DMARD.73 Meanwhile, a survey of 1100 Medicare beneficiaries determined that those with RA were 3.5 times more likely to be nonadherent with their medication because of cost than those without RA and nearly 2.5 times as likely to spend less on basic needs.74 Other contributors to nonadherence should also be considered, including patient age, access to rheumatologists, patient—physician communication, and clinical characteristics.3,75 Identifying patients at risk of nonadherence and intervening early with medication management efforts could reduce rates of nonadherence and improve outcomes.67

Pharmacy Benefit Managers and Specialty Pharmacies

Pharmacy benefit managers and specialty pharmacies have an important role in managing the drug-related costs of RA. Interventions range from negotiating discounts and rebates with manufacturers and identifying financial help for patients to improving medication adherence and managing utilization.76,77 Specialty pharmacies can also help train providers in the appropriate use of medications, determine dosing and quantity limits to avoid costly waste, recommend alternative approaches, and provide case management services.77 A 2011 survey of 50 payers, representing more than 80 million lives, determined that 80% used specialty pharmacies. The most valuable add-on services they reported were patient education, compliance programs, and the provision of adherence data.55

Encourage Interdisciplinary, Coordinated Care

Interdisciplinary, team-based care—composed of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and other medical professionals—is becoming a cornerstone of treatment for complex diseases like RA. Studies have found that such approaches can be just as, or more, effective than traditional, physician-led care, and less costly.78-80

Pharmacist-led medication therapy management (MTM) is a cost-effective approach to comprehensive patient management in several chronic diseases. Pharmacists participating in these programs currently provide an initial assessment and continue with patient-specific interventions designed to identify and resolve medication-related issues. This complements the services delivered by other members of the care team, resulting in improved outcomes.81

A study published in 2014 found that nurse-led follow-up care in patients with stable, low-activity RA and shared care without scheduled consultations resulted in lower mean scores in disease activity and higher scores for functional status and HRQoL over 2 years compared with patients seen by a rheumatologist. Patients in the nursing group also improved their self-efficacy, confidence, and satisfaction scores compared with those in the rheumatologist group. The patients seen by nurses were also significantly less costly to care for (in terms of direct clinician costs) than the group seen by rheumatologists.82 Another study comparing nurse-led care to rheumatologist-led care in 181 adults with RA determined that nurse-led care was noninferior to rheumatology care and was more cost-effective. A Canadian study reported similar results.83,84","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease that affects an estimated 0.5% to 1% of the US population, or approximately 1.5 million individuals.

This challenge will become even greater in the next decade with the introduction of new specialty drugs and the growing incidence of the disease.

Indeed, after an incredible unfettered runup over the course of 2017, it could be weeks before the market finds a true floor and is able to rekindle its former bullishness. That doesn’t necessarily mean investors must simply ride it out with what they have. The right stocks can minimize market volatility, and maybe even drive gains at a time of year that’s lethargic, at best. Here are 10 stocks to buy now for their resiliency, dependability and stability. Some are perennial winners, others are counter-cyclical plays and still others are special-situation opportunities. In all cases, however, these shares look relatively immune to the broad market’s uncertainty. Data is as of May 14, 2018.

Costco Wholesale Market value: $86.0 billion Think Costco Wholesale (COST, $195.88) is just another retailer? Think again. Although it clearly operates brick and mortar stores that invite consumers in for a shopping experience, that description doesn’t do Costco’s business model justice. This retailer was built from the ground up to also be a fee-based membership club, annually charging its customers for the privilege of spending money at its locales. It has worked. In its most recently reported quarter, membership fees accounted for $716 million in revenue, which accounted for the vast majority of the company’s $986 million in pretax income; membership fee revenue is almost all profit. Costco isn’t just a machine designed to drive membership fees. It has proverbial “buy-in” from consumers, and shoppers feel more compelled to get the most of their membership by frequenting the company’s stores more than they might otherwise. The average per-trip ticket size is much bigger at Costco than at any other comparable retailer, and on average, members spend about $2,500 per year with the company. For comparison, the average Amazon (AMZN) Prime member only spends about $1,300 at the e-commerce site per year. The fact that Costco mostly sells consumables bolsters the stability argument. Investors appreciate this kind of reliable revenue production when other companies face unclear futures.

Hormel Foods Market value: $19.0 billion Market turbulence might prompt consumers to rethink that splurge, and outright bear markets may postpone the purchase of an automobile. It’s rather uncommon for anyone to stop eating regardless of the economic environment, however. That leaves packaged-food company Hormel Foods (HRL, $36.08) in an enviable position. Hormel is the company that brings you Dinty Moore beef stew, Skippy peanut butter, Spam and a handful of canned goods with the Hormel label on them. You’ll find them in store refrigerators, on unrefrigerated shelves and even in places that use Jennie-O foodservice. Even within the anti-cyclical consumer goods sector, diversification counts. That geographic diversification rattled some shareholders just a few weeks ago, when the threat of new tariffs being imposed on foods sent from the United States to China first surfaced. Although Chinese President Xi Jinping has since backed off on those threats, the possibility lingers in the back of investors’ minds. But it might not need to. Hormel has what many other players in the business don’t have: scale. Although the company’s sales and profits ebb and flow like any other, the market knows full well that far more often than not, Hormel’s revenues and earnings roll in higher on a year-over-year basis. That easily makes it one of the top stocks to buy now for stability.

Cigna Market value: $42.8 billion Healthcare plan providers like Cigna (CI, $177.54) were certainly whipped around before and after the advent of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Its implosion in the meantime has only fanned the flames of volatility, with investors simply unsure of what the future held. But there’s more clarity on the horizon than these healthcare-focused blue-chip stocks (as a group) may be getting credit for. That growing stability is at least in part supported by the new normal in the healthcare arena – vertical integrations that will ultimately lead to cost savings. The union of drugstore chain CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) comes to mind. But Cigna is getting in on the act too with its effort to acquire pharmacy benefits manage Express Scripts (ESRX). Such deals are expected to provide consistency at the stage of drug reimbursement, which had previously been a point of friction within the healthcare sector. Investors are already pricing in that impending stability too. Cigna shares’ beta score, which compares its volatility to the broad market’s volatility, says it only swings about half as erratically as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index does. But it has handily outperformed the S&P 500 over the course of the past five years with a gain of 134%. The market’s only up about 67% for the timeframe.

Quest Diagnostics Market value: $13.9 billion In the same sense that food sales are resilient, so too is the use of diagnostic kits and the utilization of the laboratories that process them. Enter Quest Diagnostics (DGX, $102.93), the world’s largest medical diagnostics and testing company. Quest can identify and analyze everything from cancer to cholesterol to hepatitis C and more. This includes employment-driven drug-testing, which may translate into a particularly strong opportunity for the foreseeable future. With the nation’s unemployment rate now at a multi-year low of 3.9% and employers now fighting for – and possibly lowering their standards for – workers, Quest Diagnostics has observed something more than a little concerning. That is, positive drug tests (evidence that workers are drug users) are at a 10-year high. Though organizations are desperate for workers, no employer can afford the liability of an employee that may be under the influence while on the job. Look for demand for drug screening to ramp-up, in step with the fast-growing job market. Regardless, as was noted, disease diagnostics and drug-testing are the kind of services that aren’t overly subject to economically-based changes in the marketplace. While its top and bottom lines have fluctuated in the short run over the course of the past decade, the longer-term trajectory has been pointed decidedly upward. This kind of reliability makes DGX a favorite in turbulent times.

Diageo plc Market value: $89.0 billion It’s cliché, but clichés exist for a reason: Own booze company Diageo plc (DEO, $144.49) as a way of sidestepping the brunt of any pullback. The industry – and this company in particular – almost seems to thrive when most other equities are floundering, with alcohol making tough times a little easier to cope with. You may know the company better than you realize. Although it is based in the U.K., Diageo is the name behind iconic American brands like Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Captain Morgan, just to name a few. While popular in the United States, Diageo products are enjoyed in more than 180 countries, offering incredible geographic diversity to shareholders. It also offers owners oddly reliable, even if never red-hot, earnings and sales growth. The big selling point with Diageo, however, is its highly tempered volatility. With a beta reading of only 0.55, it’s only a little more than half as erratic as the S&P 500 index. That low beta reading also suggests it also sometimes moves counter to the overall market tide. More than anything, however, the low beta reading says DEO shares march to the beat of their own drum, reflecting the company’s steady growth.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities Market value: $12.8 billion When stocks as a whole start to struggle, investors are often quick to seek out other kinds of assets … commodities, bonds, and real estate. That’s why Jonathan Pappas, communications consultant for real estate PR firm Solomon McCown, thinks real estate investment trust (REIT) Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE, $126.98) could be a compelling alternative in the midst of this market turbulence. Pappas explains, “After last week’s Q1-2018 Alexandria earnings call, investors and analysts for the first time in Alexandria’s 24-year history heard Joel and leadership give increased visibility into their development/redevelopment pipeline for 2018-2019-2020. This news sent Alexandria’s stock up 4% on May 1.” He adds, “Another reason why the Street was excited about Alexandria’s long-term growth was because these Class A lab/office buildings currently under construction or pre-construction are already more than 80% pre-leased, on average – guaranteed cash flow over the next several years.” That impending cash flow makes ARE a lower-risk bet than many other equities, and REITs, when the overall market is being shaken and stirred. The kicker: Alexandria’s first-quarter top and bottom lines were both better than analysts were expecting. Revenues were up a healthy 18%, year-over-year, adding to the bullish response to the company’s new forward-looking transparency.

American Water Works Market value: $14.4 billion

$14.4 billion American Water Works (AWK, $82.67) is, to put it bluntly, a boring company. That’s meant as a compliment, though. Boring is beautiful if the alternative is an exciting but unpredictable future. Exactly as the name says, American Water Works operates water utility services, delivering water to 1,600 communities spread across 16 different states. What’s not put in print at the corporate website is that water utilities are about as much of a monopoly as an industry can get and still be permitted to operate. While competition theoretically is permitted, for all intents and purposes it’s simply too difficult for a community to tap another operator. It gets better. It wouldn’t be accurate to say it never happens, but it is rare for a municipality’s regulatory body to deny a water company’s request for a rate increase. Circle of Blue, which monitors the nation’s average monthly water bill paid by consumers, reports that the monthly cost of water has steadily grown every year since 2010, and by more than the broad inflation rate has. AWK shareholders aren’t complaining. American Water Works’ dividend yield of 2% isn’t much to celebrate, but shareholders know it’s among the best stocks to buy for dividend growth as well as safety. In 2010, AWK paid 63 cents per share. Now, it’s paying out at an annualized pace of $1.67 per share.

Walmart Market value: $249.0 billion Given its ongoing fight with Amazon, Target (TGT) and the aforementioned Costco – just to name a few -- one would expect Walmart (WMT, $84.39) shares to make their way all of the trading map, higher and lower. And to be fair, the company sees its fair share of erraticism. By and large, though, shares of the world’s biggest retailer are less than half as erratic as the S&P 500 has been over the course of the past year. It’s not terribly tough to figure out why. Its inherent problems aside, Walmart is a massive company with a finger in a lot of different pies ranging from groceries to automotive to several surprising high-end online ventures, all augmenting (of course) its core general merchandise operation. The sheer size of the company makes it a difficult outfit to push, pull or turn. The retailer’s stability goes beyond internal diversity. Its core product lines like home goods, kitchen supplies, hardware and electronics may not me outright recession-proof, but they’re quite recession-resistant. Consumers may not always be able to purchase a new car, but they won’t think twice about buying new socks or light bulbs.

Berkshire Hathaway Market value: $485.3 billion It might be cheating just a bit for an investor to delegate his or her stock-picking duties to someone else. But, if you’re going to go that route, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $199.18) is undoubtedly the way to go. The short version of the long story is, Buffett likes value stocks. He’s also a fan of companies that can consistently create cash flow, and given his historical preferences, the Oracle of Omaha has generally bought stocks that are inherently less volatile than the broad market – attributes that only took the world of academia five decades to officially figure out, even though Buffett has been willing to drop such hints for about as long. There may be another reason Berkshire Hathaway isn’t quite as erratic as the S&P 500. That is, though the fund holds a great number of publicly traded stocks, it also owns a great number of privately held businesses that can only be arbitrarily (and only occasionally) valued by accountants. Since those have no underlying stocks to speak of that create any meaningful measure of net asset value, the market tacitly acknowledges Berkshire must be valued only by its ability to create income. Ergo, Berkshire Hathaway shares aren’t pushed around by hysteria like most other equities are.","The right stocks can minimize market volatility, and maybe even drive gains at a time of year that’s lethargic, at best.

39,"May 24, 2018",The Motley Fool,These Companies Gave Bonuses or Raises After Tax Reform,"Companies will still come out ahead

There are many more companies that offered wage increases, bonuses, and other employee benefits in the wake of tax reform. Over 400 companies have announced plans to pass on some of their savings to employees in some form, with 4 million-plus workers receiving over $4 billion in bonuses, according to the GOP.

Corporations should still come out well ahead even after paying out employee bonuses. The corporate tax cuts are permanent, and most companies opted to pay a relatively small one-time bonus compared to the benefits they’ll see this year alone. It’s also unclear if the wage and benefits plan increases are more closely tied to the tax cuts or a booming job market where companies are forced to compete more aggressively for labor.

American workers are seeing more money in their pockets this year, but they need to save that money because it’s likely a one-time bonus and the personal income tax cuts aren’t permanent.

0,"Jul 24, 2015",Business Wire,Anthem Announces Definitive Agreement to Acquire Cigna Corporation,"INDIANAPOLIS & BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anthem, Inc. (NYSE:ANTM) and Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Anthem will acquire all outstanding shares of Cigna in a cash and stock transaction and Cigna shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 Anthem common shares for each Cigna common share. The total per share consideration equates to approximately $188.00 for each Cigna share based on Anthem's closing share price on May 28, 2015, valuing the transaction at $54.2 billion on an enterprise basis.

The combined company will be an industry leader with enhanced diversification and capabilities to advance the transformation of health care delivery for consumers. Following the transaction, Anthem will have more than $115 billion in pro forma annual revenues, based on the most recent 2015 outlooks publicly reported by both companies and will gain meaningful diversification covering approximately 53 million medical members with well positioned commercial, government, consumer, specialty and international franchises. Upon the close of the transaction, Joseph Swedish will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and David Cordani will be President and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, effective upon closing, the Anthem Board of Directors will be expanded to 14 members. David Cordani and four independent directors from Cigna’s current Board of Directors will join the nine current members of the Anthem Board of Directors.

The agreement provides an “unaffected” premium to Cigna’s shareholders of approximately 38.4%, based on the unaffected closing price of Cigna’s shares on May 28, 2015. Under the terms of the transaction, the consideration consists of approximately 55% cash and 45% Anthem shares, and the combined company would reflect a pro forma equity ownership comprised of approximately 67% Anthem shareholders and approximately 33% Cigna shareholders.

“We are very pleased to announce an agreement that will deliver meaningful value to consumers and shareholders through expanded provider collaboration, enhanced affordability and cost of care management capabilities, and superior innovations that deliver a high quality health care experience for consumers. We believe that this transaction will allow us to enhance our competitive position and be better positioned to apply the insights and access of a broad network and dedicated local presence to the health care challenges of the increasingly diverse markets, membership, and communities we serve. The Cigna team has built a set of capabilities that greatly complement our own offerings and the combined company will have a competitive presence across commercial, government, international and specialty segments. These expanded capabilities will enable us to better serve our customers as their health care needs evolve,” said Joseph Swedish, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anthem.

“Our companies share proud histories and an even brighter future. Going forward our new company will deliver an acceleration of innovative and affordable health and protection benefits solutions that help address our health system's challenges and provide supplemental insurance protection, and health care security to consumers, their families, and the communities we share with them. The complementary nature of our businesses will allow us to leverage the deep global health care knowledge, local market talent, and expertise of both organizations to ensure that consumers have access to affordable and personalized solutions across diverse life and health stages and position us for sustained success,” said David M. Cordani, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna.

Utilizing Anthem’s and Cigna’s complementary strengths, the combined company will be able to deliver higher quality health care as America’s valued health partner. By combining Anthem’s Blue Cross and Blue Shield footprint in 14 states and Medicaid footprint via its Amerigroup brand in 19 states with Cigna’s broad portfolio of health and protection services in the U.S. and globally, the combined company will offer a comprehensive range of high quality, high value products and services to the full spectrum of customers – individuals, employers and State and Federal governments.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, pending the receipt of customary approvals, including certain state regulatory approvals and expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. In addition, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Cigna’s shareholders of the merger agreement and Anthem’s shareholders of the issuance of shares in the transaction. Anthem is confident in its ability to obtain all necessary regulatory and other approvals.

The combined company expects to achieve adjusted earnings per share accretion approaching 10% in year one, with the accretion more than doubling by year two following the closing of the transaction. We are confident in our ability to achieve synergy targets and are committed to retaining investment grade debt ratings. Anthem expects its debt-to-capital ratio to be approximately 49% at the time of close, with a plan to bring the ratio down to the low 40% range within 24 months. Anthem has received committed financing from Bank of America, Credit Suisse and UBS Investment Bank in connection with the transaction.

Anthem and Cigna management will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at 8:30 AM EDT today, July 24, 2015. Additional materials regarding the transaction are available on our website at www.betterhealthcaretogether.com/.

Anthem’s lead financial advisor is UBS Investment Bank and Credit Suisse also served as financial advisor and its legal advisor is White & Case LLP. Morgan Stanley is acting as Cigna’s financial advisor, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP is acting as legal advisor to Cigna.

3,"Feb 9, 2017",Reuters,"Cigna, Humana could still combine despite anti-trust rulings: analysts","(Reuters) - Although judges shot down Anthem Inc's ANTM.N $54 billion acquisition of Cigna Corp CI.N and Aetna Inc's AET.N $35 billion takeover of Humana Inc HUM.N on anti-trust grounds, the rulings left scope for a possible combination of Cigna and Humana, industry insiders said.

Cigna would have both the motives and finances to pursue an acquisition of Humana, these experts suggested. Because of its much smaller Medicare Advantage business, Cigna may have a better shot at winning a regulatory green light, they added.

“They may have blocked the merger (with Aetna), but that’s not the end of the song,” said Randal Schultz, an attorney at Lathrop & Gage LLP focusing on the healthcare sector.

Cigna and Humana did not respond to requests for comment. Aetna declined to comment.

A merger of Cigna and Humana would allow them to save money by cutting back administrative costs in overlapping markets and holding down healthcare costs by boosting the combined company’s bargaining power with healthcare providers and drug makers.

To be sure, further industry consolidation is not seen as imminent following the scuppering of two mega deals in the sector. Anthem has said it wants to appeal the court ruling and Cigna is still weighing how to proceed. Aetna and Humana have yet to announce their plans.

When asked whether a big deal is out of the question right now, Cigna CEO David Cordani left the door open in a conference call last week with analysts discussing fourth-quarter earnings, saying “never say never, in terms of large versus small.”

Moreover, U.S. President Donald Trump’s intention to repeal and replace his predecessor’s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act - also known as Obamacare - will not remove the incentives for health insurers to consolidate, and could even bolster them.

With Republican lawmakers and policymakers in control of Washington, Humana’s Medicare Advantage assets could become even more valuable.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan has argued for more privatization of Medicare, the government-run insurance program for the elderly and disabled. While the White House does not yet back Ryan’s proposal for government-sponsored vouchers for private insurance plans, analysts say such a policy is likely to spur more growth and profits in privately run Medicare Advantage plans.

For Cigna, a deal with Humana could help offset its slower- growing business managing insurance plans for large companies, which makes up 85 percent of its revenues and is considered more vulnerable to economic downturns.

Cigna’s Medicare Advantage footprint is less than half that of Aetna’s, giving it a stronger footing with antitrust regulators, investors and analysts said.

“There would be a lot fewer (antitrust) objections to a Cigna buyout of Humana than there were with Aetna, and I think Humana could get a higher price,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at GAMCO Investors, which owns shares in all five big U.S. health insurers, including Humana.

The terms of any new deal would need to reflect the fact that some aspects of Humana’s business has improved since it agreed to sell itself to Aetna in 2015, Jonas said.

That includes Humana’s decision to largely withdraw from the online exchanges for individual plans set up by the Affordable Care Act last year, Jonas said. Following losses it suffered on these exchanges, Humana said this week its individual membership participation was down 70 percent.

A NEW RACE FOR HUMANA

Humana emerged as a coveted acquisition target in 2015, when an approach by Cigna triggered a sale process for the company in which Aetna prevailed. Bidders were attracted to Humana’s robust presence in the fast-growing Medicare Advantage market, where it has more than 3 million customers.

“We see real potential for Cigna to re-engage, and possibly Anthem as well to be a factor,” Justin Lake of Wolfe Research wrote in a January note.

Cigna would likely be “much more willing” than Aetna was to simply divest all of its Medicare Advantage business for antitrust reasons, which is much smaller and is growing more slowly than Aetna’s, Lake said.

In total, Aetna provides Medicare Advantage services to around 1.2 million people. Aetna had agreed to sell insurance plans serving nearly 300,000 Medicare Advantage customers to smaller peer Molina Healthcare Inc MOH.N. But that was only about half of the roughly 600,000 customers that JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said it would have needed to sell to get a green light from regulators.

Anthem could also potentially take an interest in acquiring Humana, analysts said. However, it would likely face considerably greater antitrust scrutiny. With more than $80 billion in expected annual sales, Anthem is roughly twice the size of Cigna. It also has a larger Medicare Advantage business, serving around 1.2 million people, compared with Cigna’s roughly 500,000.

While this would make it more difficult for Anthem to compete against Cigna as a suitor for Humana from an antitrust perspective, it could give Cigna grounds to argue that competition would not be stifled were it to acquire Humana, given Anthem’s major presence in the market.

Humana could also attract interest from less obvious players, including pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs) such as Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O or CVS Health Corp. CVS.N, said Leerink Partners LLC analyst Ana Gupte.

CVS had no immediate comment. Express Scripts declined to comment. The model of combining PBMs, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers, with insurance companies themselves was pioneered by UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N. It doubled down on the strategy in 2015 with the $12.8 billion acquisition of Catamaran Corp.

That business, now part of its existing OptumRX unit, outperformed analyst expectations during the latest quarter and has won some large contracts away from competitors. The company says owning the business helps it better assess customer health costs, a key component of premium pricing and profits.","Because of its much smaller Medicare Advantage business, Cigna may have a better shot at winning a regulatory green light, they added.

7,"Sep 14, 2016",The Motley Fool,How Monsanto Wrangled a Win-Win Deal Out of Bayer,"After months of drama, German chemicals giant Bayer (OTC:BAYR.Y) announced that it and Monsanto (NYSE:MON) have agreed on terms of a merger at $128 per share. The $66 billion deal will create a global giant that represents one-third of all farm inputs, from seeds to crop protection. Make no mistake though, this deal is not without controversy, and there's no easy path to approval from regulators. For Bayer, it may take just as much work getting shareholders of both companies to sign off the union as it will take getting the deal past regulators.

Still a low-ball offer

For all the sound and fury generated by Monsanto that Bayer's previous offers undervalued the biotech, the agreed-upon price -- the fourth bid the German company made for its U.S. counterpart -- is only $0.50 per share higher than the last one. It may be that the $2 billion breakup fee Bayer has offered to pay Monsanto if the merger doesn't go through was the deciding factor in the board of directors' decision to accept the offer, one that's below the $130- to $140-per-share level management had reportedly deemed acceptable.

Bayer is the second biggest producer of crop protection chemicals behind Syngenta (NYSE: SYT), which Monsanto once tried to acquire but which instead agreed to be bought by China National Chemical. Together, Bayer and Monsanto will be the global leader in seeds and will account for one-third of all global crop inputs. The deal will push Bayer's crop science division from representing 30% of total revenues to about half, a significant restructuring of its business that may not sit well with its investors.

Until Bayer began pursuing Monsanto, it had been shedding assets that were not essential to its primary pharmaceutical business as it transformed into a life sciences company. It shed its plastics business, Covestro in an IPO, as well as its diabetes care business, and it recently announced the sale of its dermatology business. The announcement in May that it wanted to buy Monsanto caused some large shareholders to call the move an ""immediate destruction"" of shareholder value and to complain that the $122-per-share offer price was too high. It would also hit Bayer's credit rating, as it will be financing the deal mostly with debt, and it already carries a heavy load.

It's not much better on Monsanto's side, as investors -- though supportive of a buyout, as the stock had lost about a third of its value from highs of $125 in 2014 -- were reportedly looking for a price closer to $140 than below $130 a stub.

The middle ground between the two extremes that Bayer chooses looks as though it will appease no one, but Monsanto might hold an ace in its hand.

The $2 billion question

Although their businesses don't overlap much, they may still face antitrust hurdles, as the industry will be consolidated in fewer hands. As noted, Syngenta is being acquired by ChemChina in a $43 billion deal, while Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DD) are in the midst of their own $130 billion merger of equals.

According to ETC Group data, Bayer-Monsanto will own 29% of the global seed market, Dow-DuPont will own 21%, and Syngenta-ChemChina will own 9%. In pesticides, the breakdown is 24%, 23%, and 16%, respectively.

The Justice Department has proved to be a harsh critic when significant concentration occurs in an industry, stopping Halliburton from taking over Baker Hughes, Aetna from acquiring Humana, Anthem from buying Cigna, and most recently, John Deere from buying Monsanto's precision planting technology.

The concentration that will occur is certain to worry regulators, which is why the $2 billion breakup fee is important. While Bayer says the high figure represents its confidence that the deal will go through, Monsanto is assuredly looking at it as a windfall to finance its future growth should the merger fail. In context, the breakup fee is equal to almost all of Monsanto's full-year 2015 profits of $2.3 billion.

In short, it's something of a win-win scenario for the biotech. Although the purchase price is below what it would prefer, it still represents a 44% premium to where its stock was trading, and it has the backstop of a big breakup fee if the deal is quashed.","After months of drama, German chemicals giant Bayer (OTC:BAYR.Y) announced that it and Monsanto (NYSE:MON) have agreed on terms of a merger at $128 per share.

8,"Dec 6, 2015",Reuters,GE calls off Electrolux appliance deal amid U.S. antitrust fight,"STOCKHOLM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Electric on Monday walked away from a $3.3 billion agreement to sell its appliances business to Sweden’s Electrolux, terminating the deal after months of opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators.

GE GE.N said it would pursue other suitors for its century-old appliance unit but declined to say who they might be.

“The appliances business is performing well and GE will continue to run the business while it pursues a sale,” the company said in a statement.

Shares of Electrolux, which sought to double its U.S. sales with the purchase, tumbled on the news, and the company said it will now focus on developing existing brands such as Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan and could look at other acquisitions.

The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit in July asking a judge to stop the deal, arguing that it would push appliance prices up by 5 percent. Electrolux, GE and larger competitor Whirlpool WHR.N make up more than 90 percent of major kitchen appliances sold to homebuilders, according to the lawsuit.

“This deal was bad for the millions of consumers who buy cooking appliances every year. Electrolux and General Electric could not overcome that reality at trial,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Gelfand of the department’s Antitrust Division.

This has been a year of megadeals but also a year of aggressive deals killed by equally aggressive U.S. antitrust authorities.

Dead deals include Comcast's CMCSA.O bid to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N, Sysco's SYY.N plan to buy US Foods, Thai Union's plan to buy Bumble Bee tuna and Applied Materials' AMAT.O scrapped plan to merge with Tokyo Electron 8035.T.

More mergers are under review including two insurance deals, Aetna's AET.N deal for Humana HUM.N and Anthem's ANTM.N planned merger with Cigna CI.N, along with a deal between Baker Hughes BHI.N and Halliburton HAL.N and Staples' SPLS.O merger with Office Depot ODP.O.

Electrolux shares fell 13.4 percent to 207 Swedish crowns, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock on Monday. They earlier touched a 14-month low of 203.2 crowns. GE closed 0.4 percent lower at $30.37.

FUTURE OF ELECTROLUX

The acquisition of GE’s appliance business would have seen Electrolux leapfrog Whirlpool as the world’s biggest appliances maker, strengthening its position in North and South America.

“We’re disappointed but we’re certainly not defeated,” Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told a conference call.

He said the firm would “continue to have a strong, robust M&A (mergers and acquisitions) process”, without elaborating.

Some analysts suggested McLaughlin might decide to leave in the face of the deal collapse.

“I’m not sure how much he will enjoy staying on now that what might have been his last deal won’t go through,” Handelsbanken Capital Markets’ Karri Rinta said.

With his family having returned to the United States several years ago, speculation has been rife McLoughlin, who has been CEO for almost five years and imported manufacturing practices from the auto industry to boost profitability, could soon leave.

McLoughlin said in a statement he remained committed to Electrolux and would continue as CEO.

In 2014, Electrolux made around 33 percent of its 112 billion crowns ($13.2 billion) of sales in North America against around 35 percent in Europe.

Before the GE deal was announced, Electrolux had been looking to buy into growth in emerging markets, a strategy it may now revisit.

The Swedish firm said GE had asked it pay out a termination fee of $175 million that was part of the transaction agreement.

It said fourth-quarter results would include about 175 million crowns of transaction and integration costs and would be hit by about 225 million crowns of costs arising from a bridge facility intended to finance the deal.","“The appliances business is performing well and GE will continue to run the business while it pursues a sale,” the company said in a statement.

10,"Jun 22, 2015",MarketWatch,Even some bad Greece news might be good news for this market,"We might not be looking at such big gains this morning were it not for the manic-depressive Athens situation, which is in full mania mode this morning.

Gains for global markets on Monday — driven by the potential for a deal that could kick Greece-euro-exit threats down the road — come at the start of a traditionally bearish week for equities. It’s the week after June options expiration, a trading period that’s been marked by losses in 11 of the past 12 years, notes Urban Carmel, blogging for The Fat Pitch.

The good news is that July, at least the first part, can be great for stocks. And oddly enough, a little Greek drama wouldn’t hurt that pattern at all, says Carmel. Read our chart(s) of the day for more on this subject.

Plenty are talking about what happens if a Greek deal isn’t reached today, with capital controls almost a foregone conclusion, given heavy recent withdrawals out of Greek banks. See our stat of the day for more on that. The Sober Look blog laid out what a cash economy in Greece would look like.

Analysts at J.P. Morgan Cazenove said now is the time to get back into the German DAX DAX, -0.68% , which is down nearly 5% this quarter and cheap versus the rest of Europe. Its strategist Mislav Matejka is also steadfast that there will be no Greece exit from the eurozone.

At some point, markets are going to move past Greece. It may be hard to keep focus today, but here’s some perspective on the situation, compliments of StockTwits trader Sean McLaughlin:

Our call of the day looks at U.S. dividend darlings — which ones to hold and which ones to fold as rates go up.

Key market gauges

A Greece-relief rally is underway. Futures on the Dow US:YMM5 and the S&P US:ESM5 are soaring, while the Europe Stoxx 600 SXXP, -0.42% is up 3% and Greece’s ASE Composite index GD, +0.66% is rocketing 7% higher. The dollar DXY, -0.17% is holding steady. The feel-good vibes spread across Asia stocks ADOW, -1.15% , though the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.90% was closed for a holiday after falling into correction territory last week. Crude CLN25, +0.16% is up, and gold US:GCN5 is pulling back further under $1,200 an ounce.

Oh, DSK’s legal woes might not be over yet.

The stat

J.P. Morgan analysts estimate that €6 billion euros ($6.8 billion) was yanked by depositors from Greek banks in the week ended June 9. Since the beginning of the year, €44 billion has been withdrawn, and €117 billion since the end of 2009. H/t Bloomberg News.

The economy

The Chicago Fed national activity index is due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, followed by existing home sales at 10 a.m. Eastern, both reports for May.

The buzz

Lots of M&A news around this morning. Energy Transfer Equity US:ETE said it’s bidding $53.1 billion for natural-gas-pipeline company Williams Cos. WMB, +1.77% . Hours earlier, Williams said it had rejected an unsolicited $48 billion buyout offer, without naming the suitor.

Cigna’s CI, +1.22% board of directors has rejected a $47.5 billion takeover offer from Anthem ANTM, +0.84% . It seems Cigna was thinking more along the lines of a strategic tie-up.

Expect a lot of Apple AAPL, +0.81% chatter after a busy weekend. The company backed down on its plan not to pay artists for the three-month trial period of Apple Music on Sunday night, hours after Taylor Swift called out the company for being cheap and said her new album “1989” won’t be part of the service.

TripAdvisor TRIP, +9.28% has fallen foul of users, who noticed that negative reviews of a popular U.K. garden attraction were disappearing from the site.

Meanwhile, Amazon AMZN, -0.05% will start using a machine-learning platform to hunt down fake reviews.

The call

Using some quantitative analysis, which basically uses math and statistical modeling, Morgan Stanley has come up with a short list of high-dividend stocks that offer the best risk-adjusted returns for investors looking for yield. The favorites are alternative-asset managers, natural gas and master limited partnerships, in which investors buy units of the partnership rather than shares of stock. Least attractive are telecom and tobacco shares. Here’s one great explanation of how interest rates can affect some dividend-paying stocks.

Strategist Adam Parker and his team say the asset classes they like have shown little sensitivity to interest-rate changes, based on tests of sensitivity to moves in the yield curve since June 2012. Here are a few of the names they like: Health Care REIT US:HCN US:HCN, Liberty Property Group US:LPT, Dominion Resources D, -1.00% , Williams Cos. WMB, +1.77% (see above for recent action), KKR & Co. KKR, +1.31% , Oaktree Capital Group US:OAK and Atmos Energy ATO, +0.66% .

Stocks hit slightly overbought territory last week, so investors may be looking to build on that strength, says Urban Carmel at Fat Pitch. However, we are in a week that’s dicey, as far as history goes. Every year since 1998, post June-options expiration has sucker-punched this market, he notes.

But as July tends to be “bullish standout,” for markets, that June gloom can be overcome, says the blogger. He points out this chart from Bespoke, showing higher prices over the past 20, 50 and 100 years in July, as evidence:

13,"Nov 21, 2016",Reuters,Anthem argues Fortune 500 will not suffer from Cigna deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anthem Inc ANTM.N and the U.S. Justice Department dug in their heels on Monday in court over whether the lower prices the health insurer expects to negotiate after buying smaller rival Cigna Corp CI.N are an efficiency that benefits customers or an antitrust violation.

The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo

In the first phase of what could be a two-stage trial, a lawyer for Anthem argued that the $45-billion deal, which was announced more than a year ago, would create a new, bigger insurer with the power to push down prices that it would pass onto customers.

But the Justice Department argued that any cost cuts would come from Anthem using its clout in the market to force hospitals and doctors to work for less.

“Efficiencies don’t count if the only way you get them is more market power,” the Justice Department’s attorney Jon Jacobs said in opening statements.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia may opt to block the proposed deal if she decides it will mean higher prices for consumers or that it hurts suppliers. The Justice Department asked her to declare the deal illegal under antitrust law.

The Justice Department’s Jacobs argued that the deal would also lead to fewer companies selling health insurance to big, nationwide employers that need a broad network of services.

Fewer companies usually means higher prices for these big companies, and Anthem’s lawyer Christopher Curran took issue with that idea. “The notion that these Fortune 500 companies are going to be victimized here ... is not realistic,” Curran said in court.

Curran also argued that the Justice Department had failed to consider the new online private exchanges where corporations allow employees to choose from multiple insurers.

Judge Jackson noted that the major insurance companies were the ones in the exchanges and asked: “How’s that the answer to the problem?”

The Justice Department’s Jacobs noted the tough competition between the companies, referring to an Anthem document. “It offered its sales force a bounty if they took business away from Aetna or Cigna,” said Jacobs.

The trial is expected to end by the end of the year.

The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop the $45-billion purchase of Cigna and Aetna Inc's AET.N $33-billion planned acquisition of Humana HUM.N, arguing that such consolidation among the largest health insurers would be anti-competitive.

Anthem attempted to make the case that it was not truly a national insurance company because it is only in 14 states.

Joseph Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, the largest member of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, testified that he would be inclined to assist another so-called blue plan land a national contract in a way it would not help one of the other major companies.

“If a blue plan reaches out to me to give help, I’ll give help,” Swedish said.

16,"Jun 14, 2016",Reuters,Wide deal spreads make juicy targets for some investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of a number of U.S. companies eyed in high-profile deals are trading significantly below their intended acquisition prices on worries that the deals will die, presenting an opportunity for some big-name investors.

The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo

The deal spreads span 10, 20 or 30 percent in some cases, against long-term averages in the low single digits, and funds such as T. Rowe Price and Franklin Mutual Advisers have made significant additions to target company shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

It’s unclear whether the funds are seizing on an arbitrage opportunity or are scooping up shares for other reasons, such as seeing value in the target company regardless of whether the deals go through. The funds declined to comment.

But shareholders stand to profit handsomely in the event the deals win approval.

Investors may be more wary about deals closing after regulatory opposition scuttled several major mergers in recent months. Halliburton's HAL.N combination with Baker Hughes BHI.N collapsed over antitrust concerns and Pfizer's PFE.N purchase of pharmaceutical rival Allergan AGN.N fell apart in the wake of new tax rules.

Risks to the pending deals stem largely from antitrust concerns, particularly in healthcare industry, or because the buyers are Chinese companies, said investors.

“The market is pricing these risks properly in our view,” said John Orrico, chief investment officer of New York-based Water Island Capital, adviser to The Arbitrage Fund, which invests exclusively in merger deals. “There is a reason you should avoid the healthcare deals, there’s a reason you should avoid these Chinese-led buyer deals.”

The average spread of 15 big merger deals involving U.S. target companies is higher than usual now at about 9 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of pending deals above $5 billion. That is above the long term average for all merger spreads, estimated by Orrico at 3 to 5 percentage points above Treasury bill rates, which are currently around 0.2 percent.

The spreads are far wider for two pending mega-mergers involving U.S. health insurers. Anthem’s ANTM.N purchase of Cigna CI.N and Aetna’s AET.N acquisition of Humana HUM.N face significant antitrust concern as they involve combining four of the five biggest companies in that industry.

Cigna shares trade at a 35-percent discount to Anthem’s offer, which has an equity value of $44 billion, while Humana is currently about 21 percent below Aetna’s offer of about $34 billion.

DOUBTS THAT DEALS WILL CLOSE

The wide spreads indicate strong doubts that deals will close, adding some risk to owning the target company shares. Investors who buy now hoping to profit may find that a scuttled deal drags the stock down lower.

But the wider the spread, the closer the shares may be to their price without a merger premium. That could mean less of a fall should the deal collapse.

Take Cigna. At $126 a share, the stock is trading below where it was a year ago when news of the deal broke. That could soothe current investors, although the stock’s downside is unclear, given that Cigna shares had begun 2015 at $103 a share.

T. Rowe Price and MFS Investments made big additions to their Cigna holdings in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, during which time the spread for the cash-and-stock Anthem offer averaged 25 percent. Both funds declined to comment.

“If the deal is successfully completed, (institutional holders) will make the arbitrage spread and come out long the acquiring company,” said Roy Behren, portfolio manager of Westchester Capital Management’s The Merger Fund in Valhalla, New York. “And if the deal is blocked, they may lose a little bit in the short run, but they would believe that they would make money as the stock realizes its intrinsic value.”

Antitrust concerns also cloud Walgreens Boots Alliance's WBA.O $9 billion bid for drugstore-chain rival Rite Aid RAD.N, whose shares trade around a 15 percent discount to the offer.

Franklin Mutual Advisers, the third-largest Rite Aid shareholder, added virtually its whole position of nearly 30 million shares during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Franklin’s specific funds that added Rite Aid shares are known for investing in merger arbitrage opportunities, according to Morningstar. Franklin declined to comment.

Several deals with Chinese acquirers have encountered snafus, prompting fears about similar acquisitions. Ingram Micro IM.N is trading about 12 percent below a $6 billion bid from Chinese conglomerate HNA Group's unit Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co Ltd 600751.SS, amid questions about securing U.S. government approvals.

Outside of the United States, Swiss pesticides maker Syngenta SYNN.S is trading at around an 18-percent discount to an offer from state-owned ChemChina. The deadline for shareholders to accept the deal was recently pushed back to allow for regulatory approvals.

Another recent acquisition bid in the agricultural sector may present an opportunity.

U.S. seed company Monsanto MON.N last month turned down a $122-per-share offer from Germany's Bayer BAYGn.DE, but sources have told Reuters that Monsanto has left the door open to a possible deal.

Nonetheless, Monsanto shares are trading at $107, 14 percent below the initial offer.","Investors may be more wary about deals closing after regulatory opposition scuttled several major mergers in recent months.

17,"May 4, 2016",TheStreet,Sudden Departure of Anthem CFO Raises Questions,"Wayne DeVeydt has many charitable pursuits, and some analysts don't see anything amiss despite the move coming as the company and Cigna await approval of their $54.2 billion merger.

The sudden departure of Anthem (ANTM) - Get Anthem, Inc. Report CFO Wayne DeVeydt on Wednesday raises more questions than answers as the health insurer and rival Cigna (CI) - Get Cigna Corporation Report await regulatory approval for their $54.2 billion deal.

But it also may be more reason to buy shares in the health insurer, according to at least one company follower.

Shares of Anthem and Cigna finished down 1.9% to $138.73 and 1.8% to $135.30, respectively, on Wednesday.

""Until the merger takes place, it's all just moving parts and you can't draw too many conclusions,"" said Charles Elson, chief of the University of Delaware's Center for Corporate Governance. ""A lot can happen between now and then.""

While the unexpected news is likely to pressure shares, Stifel, Nicholaus & Co. analyst Thomas Carroll doesn't suspect the CFO move indicates ""anything amiss"" at Anthem.

In fact, Carroll wrote in the note that ""our gut reaction is that this is more supportive of traction for deal closure than not,"" and therefore supports continued ownership of Anthem shares. The incoming CFO, John Gallina, is likely a better chief financial officer for integration with Cigna, according to the analyst.

DeVeydt, who became CFO of Anthem in 2007, had previously held various positions at the company or affiliated companies since 1994. The departure of the well-liked CFO will take effect May 31 and is the result of family commitments and philanthropic work, according to the May 4 statement.

DeVeydt's reasoning for departure by no means appears forced, as he currently serves on the Board of Governors at Boys & Girls Clubs of America and is a board member at the Cancer Support Community charity. He's also a member of the Habitat for Humanity International charity and board member at YMCA of Greater Indianapolis, according to relationship mapping service BoardEx, an affiliate of The Deal.

The incoming CFO, John Gallina, most recently served as division CFO for Anthem's commercial and specialty business unit and has held various positions with the company since June 1994.

""John Gallina has a long operational history at the company and is very familiar with how ANTM is wired,"" Carroll wrote. ""Moreover, let us not forget that he was in charge of the financial integration of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks a decade ago.""

On the flip side, should Anthem suspect the deal is unlikely to go through, the timing may be opportune to pass along the CFO reins to the ""quite capable"" Gallina, Carroll said.

When Anthem, the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield company in the nation, finally succeeded in reaching an agreement to acquire Cigna in July, it came after months of discussions about a deal that was believed to have dragged on over negotiations involving the management structure.

While Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish will assume the initial role of chief executive of the combined company, he is expected to step down two years after the deal's completion. At that point, Cigna CEO David Cordani is expected to take the helm while Swedish continues to serve as chairman.

Cordani had initially wanted to be the CEO right away, and so that decision is viewed as a compromise between the two management teams, one person familiar with the two companies noted.

If and when Cordani takes the helm at that point, he would likely look to install his own CFO, according to Stifel's Carroll.

In addition to the new roles, the Anthem board will be expanded to 14 members. Cordani and four directors from Cigna's current board will join the nine members currently on Anthem's board.

How the two companies plan to integrate will remain of interest as the deal progresses given the distinct cultures of Indianapolis-based Anthem and Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna, the unnamed source noted.

While Cigna has been pretty aggressive trying to expand the breadth and depth of service offerings outside of its core insurance business, Anthem has been in the mode of shutting down a lot of non-core businesses, this person noted.

More specifically, Anthem has performed well in the exchange market, has a local focus, has a Medicaid franchise and has leading Medicare supplement and Medicare advantage business while catering to individuals. Cigna is strong in the dental, vision, behavioral health and wellness spaces, as well as having a strong national platform of employer groups.

From a financial standpoint, Cigna has seen better returns in recent years.

Cigna has generated a five-year annualized return of about 24.14% and one-year annualized return of about 6.71%, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, Anthem's five- and one-year annualized returns are 12.28% and -9.83%, respectively.","The sudden departure of Anthem (ANTM) - Get Anthem, Inc.

In honor of the holiday, here are some of the most interesting partnerships in contemporary business.

The Dysfunctional Couple

Pharmaceutical companies Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Alere Inc (NYSE: ALR) announced their engagement in February 2016. Abbott got cold feet after Alere exposed financial struggles, but Alere rejected an attempted breakup. Ever since, lawsuits alleging contract violations have flown in both directions. Abbott is still trying to back out in spite of Alere’s persistent possessiveness.

The Model Couple

Back in 2000, Glaxo Wellcome PLC and SmithKline Beecham sealed the $75.7 billion deal and, as a team, took the name GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE: GSK). Their union followed a brief period of tension — what was described as a “bitter power struggle” — but the differences weren’t insurmountable. The monolithic drug company has since powered through two decades and shows no signs of slowing — despite one investor’s encouragement to part ways.

The Power Couple

As in, the couple so powerful it probably shouldn’t have been approved. In October, Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (ADR) (NYSE: BUD) took in SABMiller in a $105 billion deal. Their union established the world’s largest beer company and had significant positive implications for the Anheuser Busch name.

The Couple We All Ship

Because the most attractive, most popular, most prosperous and most creative individuals always belong together, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) have naturally been shipped among Wall Street fandom. Some have even drawn mock-ups of their future child — the iCar.

The Couple That Denies It But We’re Still Pretty Sure…

Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: BKD) announced early February it would skip the RBC conference due to a “scheduling conflict” — but the timing left investors suspicious. A few weeks earlier, the company had been the subject of takeover rumors involving Blackstone Group LP (NYSE: BX) but declined to comment on the veracity.

The “How Did That Ever Happen” Couple

It’s been called a “mistake.” It’s been labeled “disastrous.” However it’s qualified, the fact is Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC)’s 2008 takeover of Countrywide Financial sucked more than $50 billion from the Bank’s mortgage business. Bank of America might have been better off single.

The Couple We Wish Never Happened

Back in 2000, AOL, Inc. (NYSE: AOL) and Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX) defied the advice of dissenting friends and tied the messiest, most durable knot. Investors are still trying to untangle it.

The $350 billion deal — the largest in American history — was followed by a series of plagues, including loss of jobs and retirement accounts, executive turnover, and investigations by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. Ten years later, the companies’ combined value was about one-seventh of its pre-merger rate, and its trials have continued.

The “Better Off As Friends” Couple

Aetna Inc (NYSE: AET) had been courting Humana Inc (NYSE: HUM) since July 2015. The summer fling turned into a two-and-a-half-year relationship, but significant opposition from regulatory agencies led the two to part ways. The $37 billion merger dissolved, and Humana will pay a $1 billion breakup fee.

The Love Triangle

The rare kind in which everyone wins. In December, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA) and Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD) welcomed Fred’s, Inc. (NASDAQ: FRED) to the team to legitimize their impending merger deal. The pair divested 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred’s in a win-win-win situation.

Every week, Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) is rumored to be dancing with a new partner. First, it’s News Corp (NASDAQ: NWSA). Then it’s Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Now it’s Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO). No, it’s salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM).

(NASDAQ: BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to identifying, in-licensing and developing promising therapeutic candidates, announced today the publication of positive results from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BL-5010, a novel formulation for the non-surgical removal of skin lesions. The successful trial results were published online in the prestigious British Journal of Dermatology.

Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, BioLineRx CEO said: ""We are proud to have the results of the BL-5010 clinical trial published in the British Journal of Dermatology. This is one of our most promising clinical candidates, as reflected by the out-licensing agreement we recently signed with Omega Pharma, and by the excellent results of the clinical trial. The results not only show that BL-5010 is highly effective in removing seborrheic keratosis, but also that 94.6% of the investigators and 84% of the patients who participated in the trial reported that they were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcome of the treatment and that the results were good or excellent 180 days following treatment. BL-5010 offers a novel method for removing skin lesions without surgery, anesthesia or significant adverse effects, and we look forward to seeing this innovative product on the market.""

The publication details the results, which were previously disclosed by BioLineRx in December 2010, of an open-label, single-arm trial conducted in 60 patients with seborrheic keratosis in Germany and the Netherlands. The objectives of the study were to determine the safety and efficacy of BL-5010 in completely removing the lesion and to assess the cosmetic outcome of the novel treatment. The study also aimed at evaluating BL-5010's feasibility in preserving the lesions for subsequent histological examination.

The results of the trial show that for nearly all patients (96.7%), the lesion fell off within 30 days of a single application of BL-5010. Furthermore, the results show that BL-5010 has a good safety profile, as no persistent irreversible adverse effects were observed at the treated site. Histological examination of the lesions showed that BL-5010 enables preservation of the histological structure of the treated lesion.

24,"Apr 5, 2017",Benzinga,Teens Find 100-Year-Old Converse To Be Cooler Than Under Armour,"The current fashion cycle is favoring retro styles; companies with long, storied histories are bringing back and refreshing old classics.

This bodes well for adidas AG (ADR) (OTC: ADDYY), Puma and Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE)'s Converse and poses a problem for Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA)'s fairly recent entrance into the shoe market.

A recent study by Google on Generation Z suggests that Converse, a 100-year-old brand owned by Nike, is more popular with teens than Under Armour, a brand that has aggressively marketed to younger consumers.

'Teens Are Obsessed With Shoes'

Generation Z consists of those born between the mid-1990s and early-2000s and their tastes differ from the Millennial generation. This generation of roughly 60 million has never known life without the Internet. Gen. Z has $44 billion in purchasing power in the U.S., but that figure could be closer to $200 billion when incorporating their influence on parental or household purchases.

The study from Google indicated shoes are the currency of cool for Gen Z, but Under Armour failed to make the list — despite the brand's top endorser, Steph Curry, being listed as one of the generation's most-mentioned celebrities. The company also failed to make the list of top 10 coolest companies, while competitor Nike came in at No. 9.

""Teens are obsessed with shoes. Within the clothes/fashion/beauty category, almost 30 percent of the responses of what is cool were ‘shoes.' To Gen Z, the top three coolest shoe brands are Jordan, Converse and Vans,"" the report said.

Under Armour knows it needs to go after the next generation of athletes and stars to help shape the mind of future consumers. The company stepped up its game in basketball shoes. While it made a splash initially, the basketball shoe market as a whole has struggled, and Under Armour has no retro styles to capitalize on.

Shoes have been a big part of Under Armour’s push to compete with Nike, but right now Adidas has stepped into the spotlight and is winning the battle.

27,"Jun 29, 2015",TheStreet,3 Health Care M&A Deals and How Billionaire Investors are Playing Them,"The health care industry is bursting with opportunity right now, perhaps especially on the M&A front. Billionaire investors aren't missing out.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The health care industry is bursting with opportunity right now, perhaps especially on the deal front. Billionaire investors aren't missing out.

The U.S. Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling on Thursday rejecting a challenge to the use of federal subsidies in the Affordable Care Act wasn't just a win for President Obama. It also bodes well for the health care sector and its investors in what has already been a strong run in recent months.

The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) - Get Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund Report, which tracks the health care companies listed on the S&P 500, gained more than 20% in 2014. It has climbed an additional 10% year-to-date.

Mergers and acquisitions are among the main forces driving the sector, and last week's ruling is expected to intensify health care M&A activity. Novartis (NVS) - Get Novartis AG Sponsored ADR Report got the ball rolling on Monday with the announcement of a deal to buy biotech company Spinifex.

Billionaire investors and hedge fund managers like Bill Ackman and Larry Robbins are among those enjoying the benefits health care's stock market run and profusion of deals. And they stand to make even more. (Average investors can follow along at BillionairesPortfolio.com, which provides insights into sophisticated hedge fund analyses and strategies, tracks billionaire health care M&A bets and helps average investors to do the same.)

Here is a look at three potential M&A deals and how the billionaires are playing them.

1. Zoetis - Valeant

WSJ reported on June 25 that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) has approached Zoetis (ZTS) - Get Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS) Report regarding a potential acquisition. Should the deal come to life, potentially no one will be happier than Bill Ackman.

The billionaire at the helm of Pershing Square has major stakes in both companies. As per his most recent holdings disclosure, Ackman's top position is Valeant, of which he holds 19.5 million shares. He also has a sizable investment in Zoetis, with 41.8 million shares.

Pfizer (PFE) - Get Pfizer Inc. Report spun off Zoetis in 2013. The animal health care company caught Bill Ackman's eye in 2014, and in November, his fund disclosed an 8.3% stake in the firm. He has since maneuvered to secure Ackman's Pershing Square space on the Zoetis board and pressured the company to cut costs, including laying off as much as 25% of its workforce.

Though Ackman waited until early 2015 to invest directly in Valeant, he has had a relationship with the company for quite some time and in 2014 teamed up with it in an ultimately failed bid to acquire Botox maker Allergan (AGN) - Get Allergan plc Report. In May, he called Valeant the next Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) - Get BRK.A Report (BRK.B) - Get Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B Report.

A potential Valeant-Zoetis transaction appears to be in the earliest of stages, but it isn't the first or last bid we'll see from Valeant. The company completed the acquisition of specialty pharmaceutical company Salix in April, CEO Michael Pearson told Bloomberg in May that the firm has been and will continue to make acquisitions.

Other billionaires could get a boost off of a Valeant-Zoetis merger as well. Andreas Halvorsen, Steve Mandel and Larry Robbins have stakes in Valeant, and George Soros has invested in Zoetis.

2. Anthem - Cigna

A merger between Anthem (ANTM) - Get Anthem, Inc. Report and Cigna (CI) - Get Cigna Corporation Report would have an enormous impact on the health insurance industry. And as eager as Anthem seems to be to take over Cigna, Cigna isn't having it.

On June 20, Anthem made a $184 per share bid for Cigna and confirmed that the two had been in talks for quite some time. Cigna rebuffed the proposal the next day, calling it inadequate and not in the best interests of its shareholders.

Anthem reiterated its commitment to its bid on June 22, and CEO Joseph Swedish said in a statement that combined, the companies ""will generate approaching $2 billion in synergies with two years post close and at least $17 adjusted earnings per share by 2018.""

Should the two sides come to an agreement on deal terms, Larry Robbins will score a big win. The Glenview Capital manager, who was one of the first Wall Street heavyweights to bet on Obamacare, has stakes in both companies.

As per his latest holdings disclosure corresponding to the end of the first quarter, Robbins holds 4.9 million shares of Anthem. He also has nearly 1.8 million shares of Cigna.

It is worth noting that Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates has small positions in both companies as well.

3. Aetna - Humana

According to a June 25 Bloomberg report, Aetna (AET) is closing in on the acquisition of Humana (HUM) - Get Humana Inc. (HUM) Report. The potential deal between Anthem and Cigna intensified discussions, and Aetna is said to have made a formal bid last week.

But there are other players in the mix.

Cigna has also approached Humana with an offer, and Anthem has previously expressed interest as well. According to Bloomberg, however, Humana prefers the bid from Aetna.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) - Get UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Report, the largest health insurer in the United States, could also make a bid to buy Aetna, which may nix the Humana deal.

Should the Aetna-Humana deal prevail, Larry Robbins would again be a major beneficiary. Humana is one of his top positions, and as of the end of the first quarter, he owns more than five million of its shares. He also has 3.5 million shares of Aetna.

Robbins isn't alone in recognizing the potential value of Humana, which is a leader in the Medicare Advantage market. Leon Cooperman initiated a new position in the company during the first quarter of 2015, and Andreas Halvorsen and Ray Dalio are shareholders as well.

Dalio also owns over 100,000 shares of potential Aetna acquirer UnitedHealth.

(Nasdaq: RDUS), a science-driven biopharmaceutical company developing novel differentiated therapeutics for patients with advanced osteoporosis as well as other serious endocrine-mediated diseases including metastatic breast cancer, today announced that it has engaged Myrtle Potter & Company, LLC. to support the development of the future global commercial strategy for its lead investigational drug abaloparatide-SC for the potential treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis.

""We are pleased to have the benefit of Myrtle Potter & Company's track record and experience as we prepare to transition Radius from a development stage company to a fully integrated commercial entity. We believe this collaboration will accelerate our disease-awareness efforts to transform the understanding of osteoporosis, which, over the longer term, could help improve the treatment of patients with incident osteoporotic fractures,"" said Radius Health CEO, Robert E. Ward. ""Myrtle and her team's commercial expertise will be a valuable addition to our already strong leadership as we advance our investigational new drug abaloparatide-SC towards regulatory submissions later this year in the U.S. and the EU and prepare for our first potential commercial launch.""

In June 2015, Radius expects to report the topline 6 month results from the Phase 3 ACTIVExtend trial. These results from ACTIVExtend will be combined with the already completed Phase 3 ACTIVE trial to provide the 24 month data set to be submitted this year to the FDA as a portion of the new drug application (""NDA"") for abaloparatide-SC. In December 2014, Radius reported that our Phase 3 (ACTIVE) study evaluating abaloparatide-SC met the primary endpoint (86% reduction in new vertebral fractures versus placebo) as well as key secondary endpoints (43% reduction in non-vertebral fractures versus placebo). Radius is on track for NDA submission to the FDA and MAA submission to EMA by year-end.

The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and the National Bone Health Alliance (NBHA) have highlighted the critical need to improve the screening, diagnosis and treatment for the estimated 2 million Americans who suffer osteoporotic fractures each year. Osteoporosis remains a major unmet medical need as NHBA reports a treatment gap that may impact as many as 80% of these cases.

""We have a long history of working with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to maximize the commercial value of their innovative products,"" said Myrtle Potter, CEO. ""We are eager to work with Radius as they seek to launch the first new therapy in many years into the large and growing osteoporosis market, particularly as it may have the potential to benefit the large number of patients at risk of non-vertebral fractures for whom there remains a significant unmet medical need.""

Founded in 2005 by Myrtle Potter, Myrtle Potter & Company specializes in devising novel strategies to maximize the value of prescription drug brands and portfolios. Prior to founding Myrtle Potter & Company, Myrtle was president and chief operating officer of Genentech for five years, where she led the company's launch of seven products, including the blockbuster cancer therapy Avastin™.

33,"Jul 22, 2016",Benzinga,What Is An Options Sweep?,"As stock option trading has become more popular and sophisticated, the jargon associated with options has expanded dramatically. For example, you may have heard traders refer to an “options sweep.”

A sweep is typically a large order that is broken into a number of different smaller orders that can then be filled more quickly on multiple exchanges. A sweep order instructs your broker to identify the best prices on the market, regardless of offer size, and fill your order piece-by-piece until the entire order has been filled.

These types of orders are especially useful for option traders who prefer speed over the lowest possible price.

Related Link: How Do You Trade Options?

There are two reasons why stock and option traders care when large sweep orders get placed in the options market.

Sweeps are typically large blocks, meaning that the trader placing the order has some major financial backing.

Sweep orders indicate that the buyer wants to take a position in a hurry, which could imply that he or she is anticipating a large move in the underlying stock’s share price in the very near future.

By keeping an eye out for large option trades, traders can get a feel for what market high-rollers are thinking ahead of potential stock catalysts. Benzinga Professional reported large call option sweeps in Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc – Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ: JAZZ), Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA) and Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE: HOG) on July 22.

35,"Aug 28, 2015",The Wrap,"CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on Bill Cosby Scandal, Whoopi Goldberg: Comedian’s Argument ‘Is Absurd’","Over the last year, the scandal surrounding Bill Cosby has been the subject of countless hours of TV news as broadcast and cable news networks spoke to dozens of women accusing the comedy icon of drugging and raping them.

CNN “New Day” anchor Alisyn Camerota was one the journalists leading the charge, and used her background as a former crime reporter for “America’s Most Wanted” to sort through fact or fiction. Since joining the cable news network last summer, she has interviewed a dozen of Cosby’s alleged victims — each one more than once — and maintains “very, very, very rarely does someone make a false claim.”

“I have not really been surprised that things seem to be reaching a crescendo because I think when there’s a groundswell of this many victims it does keep building on itself,” she told TheWrap in a wide-ranging interview. “Barbara Bowman really opened the floodgates and then a tidal wave happened where there’s a phenomenon in strength in numbers.”

Since the 1,000-page deposition was released last week, Camerota spoke with several of the accusers. “They feel truly vindicated,” she said.

As a TV news pro, the morning anchor knows the most important thing is finding the fresh angle on the big story, but with the Cosby saga, ripe with a gauntlet of storylines — sexual assault, race, celebrity — it’s wasn’t automatically clear where to begin.

“It does have all those different angles,” she said, explaining that she started with a focus on the accusers’ stories, which were so “strikingly similar.”

Also Read: Bill Cosby Is 'Guilty as Hell,' Donald Trump Says

After it became clear there had to be a call to action, Camerota, like the accusers, asked, “Now what?”

“How do you make someone who you said did this pay?” the anchor asked. And through conversations with accusers, Camerota explained many hope there’s a flicker of hope that through a defamation lawsuit and the 2008 case, Cosby will have his day in court.

See photos: Bill Cosby Scandal Timeline: From First Accusation to Fallout From Explosive Deposition

But even with the court of public opinion reaching a guilty verdict on Cosby long ago, Camerota still had to put on her detective hat as an anchor, reading the accusers she interviewed to evaluate if any were lying or showing an agenda.

Luckily, her experience interviewing victims and fugitives gave her plenty of expertise.

“In my experience, very, very, very rarely does someone make a false claim, and the reason is it’s embarrassing; it’s humiliating,” Camerota said. “Nobody wants to talk about something so personal, and so ugly that they say happened to them, and say it on national television.”

Also read: Hannibal Buress Says Praise for Popularizing Bill Cosby Scandal 'Is Conflicting'

This insight made Camerota inclined to believe Cosby had done wrong: “These were women that weren’t looking for fame, or money from him, so what would be their motivation to come forward? They have families, they have jobs, why would they risk their reputation and their privacy to come forward if not just for the sake of telling the truth.”

Vice versa, Camerota made up her mind quickly after watching Cosby’s bizarre silent interview with the Associated Press, reading the 2005 deposition, and hearing suggestions he didn’t think his actions were rape.

“The thing that blows that whole excuse out of the water is the Quaaludes — you can’t say you’re having nonsexual sex when you’re feeding them Quaaludes,” Camerota continued, noting the powerful drug incapacitates people, pouring cold water on Cosby likening it to giving a woman a glass of wine. “His argument that this was consensual is absurd on its face because you don’t have to drug women if you’re having consensual sex.”

Another argument people found absurd was made by “The View” co-host Whoopi Goldberg, who initially defended Cosby, citing America’s standard of being innocent until proven guilty.

Also read: Whoopi Goldberg Flip-Flops on Bill Cosby: 'All of the Information ... Points to Guilt'

“I take Whoopi at her word that it was hard to speak out against a fellow comedian, particularly a black comedian, but at the end of the day, when the evidence suggests he was at least doing something untoward and against women’s wishes, even for Whoopi, she had to admit the preponderance of evidence now seemed to not support what she said all along.”

“Not only celebrities, but we had some of the victims come on who were black, and they said it was hard for them to come forward because he was such a pillar, he was a pillar of the entertainment community,” Camerota continued. “He had this outward appearance of being such a role model and such a stand-up guy.”

Like the rest of the media, Camerota doesn’t have a crystal ball to take a peek at Cosby’s future, but she does have the first sentence of his obituary written.

“The legendary comedian, once America’s favorite television dad, became embattled and disgraced under the cloud of sexual assault allegations from dozens of women.”","Over the last year, the scandal surrounding Bill Cosby has been the subject of countless hours of TV news as broadcast and cable news networks spoke to dozens of women accusing the comedy icon of drugging and raping them.

37,"Jan 30, 2017",Insider Monkey,10 Largest Health Insurance Companies In America,"Most of the 10 largest health insurance companies in America are publicly-traded and have registered solid returns over the past five years. The US health insurance industry is one of the largest in the world with almost 84% of Americans being covered by at least some kind of public or private health insurance. While a majority of Americans obtain insurance through their employers a large part of Americans receive health coverage through a public health insurance program. Medicare, Medicaid and military health insurance accounts for a majority of the public health coverage.

Employer-sponsored health insurance is paid by companies on behalf of their employees as part of an employee benefit package. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that more than 60% Americans receive private health insurance through employers. The employer generally contributes about 85% of the insurance premium for their employees while the employee has to pony up the rest. The advantage of an employer insurance plan is that group insurance leads to lower costs due to economies of scale.

While all major US corporations still give health insurance to their workers, this trend has reversed over the last decade. The main reason is the rising costs of healthcare which has risen much faster than overall wages and inflation. The 10 largest health insurance companies in America have managed to keep growing revenues due to industry consolidation. You might also want to know about 11 biggest insurance companies in the world.

The US health insurance market is controlled by large health insurance companies after a wave of consolidation took place in the industry leading to over 400 mergers and acquisitions. According to the American Medical Insurance, the largest insurer controls at least 30% of the market in 90% of markets. This oligopoly like structure gives a lot of pricing power to the insurers as the companies/individuals have limited choice. As the U.S. population becomes older, demand for healthcare insurance is only going to increase. There is also a lot of uncertainty regarding how healthcare industry will look like with Donald Trump looking to overturn the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 which had been championed by Barack Obama. We have listed down the the 10 largest health insurance companies in America based on their 2015 revenues.","Most of the 10 largest health insurance companies in America are publicly-traded and have registered solid returns over the past five years.

0,"Jul 21, 2016",,U.S. sues to block 2 major healthcare mergers,"The Department of Justice is suing four major health insurance companies in an attempt to block two proposed mergers.

The antitrust lawsuits were announced Thursday by Attorney General Loretta Lynch in response to Anthem's (ANTX) $54 billion proposal to acquire Cigna (CI) and Aetna's (AET) $37 billion takeover of Humana (HUM).

If the two mergers proceed, Anthem would insure 53 million members and Aetna would cover 33 million.

That would drop the number of health insurance providers from five major players to three -- United Health is the other major provider.

UnitedHealthcare acquired Catamaran, a prescription provider and pharmacy-benefits manager, for $12.8 billion in 2015.

Lynch said that if the ""big five became the big three,"" then Americans and their bank accounts would suffer.

She also said the mergers would come at the expense of members and doctors.

Assistant Attorney General William Baer said the two mergers would leave consumers at risk by reducing benefits and raising premiums.

He also stressed that the most vulnerable would be hit the hardest and that competition would be reduced.

""These are so-called solutions that we cannot accept,"" Baer said.

He added that the mergers are a ""convenient shortcut to increase profit for these two companies,"" and that the DOJ had ""zero confidence"" that they would benefit consumers.

Both Anthem and Aetna said they intend to fight the suits.

Anthem said the DOJ's response was an ""unfortunate and misguided step backwards for access to affordable healthcare for America.""

(NYSE:MOH) today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire certain Medicare Advantage assets from both Aetna Inc. (NYSE:AET) and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM). These transactions are related to Aetna’s proposed acquisition of Humana. Molina’s acquisition of such Medicare Advantage assets is subject to CMS approvals and actions, customary closing conditions including state and other regulatory approvals, as well as the resolution, in a manner permitting the acquisition, of the pending litigation brought by the United States Department of Justice challenging Aetna’s proposed acquisition of Humana.

“We view this as an exceptional opportunity to significantly expand our health plan product portfolio in new and existing geographies, while maintaining our commitment to government-sponsored programs,” said J. Mario Molina M.D., president and chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare, Inc. “Medicare Advantage patients require a significant amount of care coordination. Through our experience in coordinating the care for members in our existing Medicare Advantage, Medicare Special Needs, and Medicare-Medicaid Plan offerings, we have developed a unique understanding of the challenges Medicare patients face every day and the tools required to provide them with the highest quality of service. This experience and insight will be invaluable as we integrate and continue to grow this business. We look forward to working closely with Aetna and Humana to ensure a smooth transition.”

Under the terms of the agreements, Molina will acquire, in all-cash transactions, certain assets related to Aetna and Humana’s Medicare Advantage businesses in 21 states which will result in approximately 290,000 Medicare Advantage members transitioning to Molina.

The transactions are expected to be accretive to Molina’s earnings upon closing.

4,"Sep 8, 2015",Latest Headlines on CNN Business,AMA says insurance mergers will raise premiums and hurt quality of care,"The American Medical Association says the proposed mergers between four of the nation's largest health insurers will drive up costs for patients and hurt the quality of care.

In a study released by the physicians' trade association, the AMA argues that insurance competition would be significantly reduced in 97 metropolitan areas spread across most states. It's calling for the mergers to be blocked.

""A lack of competition in health insurer markets is not in the best interests of patients or physicians,"" said Dr. Steven Stack, the AMA's president, in a news release.

Stack said a merger between health insurance giants would result in ""higher-than-competitive premiums"" for patients and employers, while doctors may be ""pressured to accept unfair terms that undermine their role as patient advocates and their ability to provide high-quality care.""

In July Anthem (ANTX) reached a deal to buy Cigna (CI) in a $54 billion deal, while Aetna (AET) agreed to buy Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. If the deals are approved by regulators it would leave three major insurers providing most of the nation's private health insurance.

The AMA came out opposed to both deals in a statement at the end of July just after then Anthem-Cigna deal was announced. This study is the next step the group is taking to lobby regulators to block the two combinations.

The AMA study argues the mergers would exceed federal antitrust guidelines designed to preserve competition when major companies merge.

Spokespeople for the four insurers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The American Medical Association says the proposed mergers between four of the nation's largest health insurers will drive up costs for patients and hurt the quality of care.

6,"Jun 14, 2016",Reuters,Wide deal spreads make juicy targets for some investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of a number of U.S. companies eyed in high-profile deals are trading significantly below their intended acquisition prices on worries that the deals will die, presenting an opportunity for some big-name investors.

The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo

The deal spreads span 10, 20 or 30 percent in some cases, against long-term averages in the low single digits, and funds such as T. Rowe Price and Franklin Mutual Advisers have made significant additions to target company shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

It’s unclear whether the funds are seizing on an arbitrage opportunity or are scooping up shares for other reasons, such as seeing value in the target company regardless of whether the deals go through. The funds declined to comment.

But shareholders stand to profit handsomely in the event the deals win approval.

Investors may be more wary about deals closing after regulatory opposition scuttled several major mergers in recent months. Halliburton's HAL.N combination with Baker Hughes BHI.N collapsed over antitrust concerns and Pfizer's PFE.N purchase of pharmaceutical rival Allergan AGN.N fell apart in the wake of new tax rules.

Risks to the pending deals stem largely from antitrust concerns, particularly in healthcare industry, or because the buyers are Chinese companies, said investors.

“The market is pricing these risks properly in our view,” said John Orrico, chief investment officer of New York-based Water Island Capital, adviser to The Arbitrage Fund, which invests exclusively in merger deals. “There is a reason you should avoid the healthcare deals, there’s a reason you should avoid these Chinese-led buyer deals.”

The average spread of 15 big merger deals involving U.S. target companies is higher than usual now at about 9 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of pending deals above $5 billion. That is above the long term average for all merger spreads, estimated by Orrico at 3 to 5 percentage points above Treasury bill rates, which are currently around 0.2 percent.

The spreads are far wider for two pending mega-mergers involving U.S. health insurers. Anthem’s ANTM.N purchase of Cigna CI.N and Aetna’s AET.N acquisition of Humana HUM.N face significant antitrust concern as they involve combining four of the five biggest companies in that industry.

Cigna shares trade at a 35-percent discount to Anthem’s offer, which has an equity value of $44 billion, while Humana is currently about 21 percent below Aetna’s offer of about $34 billion.

DOUBTS THAT DEALS WILL CLOSE

The wide spreads indicate strong doubts that deals will close, adding some risk to owning the target company shares. Investors who buy now hoping to profit may find that a scuttled deal drags the stock down lower.

But the wider the spread, the closer the shares may be to their price without a merger premium. That could mean less of a fall should the deal collapse.

Take Cigna. At $126 a share, the stock is trading below where it was a year ago when news of the deal broke. That could soothe current investors, although the stock’s downside is unclear, given that Cigna shares had begun 2015 at $103 a share.

T. Rowe Price and MFS Investments made big additions to their Cigna holdings in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, during which time the spread for the cash-and-stock Anthem offer averaged 25 percent. Both funds declined to comment.

“If the deal is successfully completed, (institutional holders) will make the arbitrage spread and come out long the acquiring company,” said Roy Behren, portfolio manager of Westchester Capital Management’s The Merger Fund in Valhalla, New York. “And if the deal is blocked, they may lose a little bit in the short run, but they would believe that they would make money as the stock realizes its intrinsic value.”

Antitrust concerns also cloud Walgreens Boots Alliance's WBA.O $9 billion bid for drugstore-chain rival Rite Aid RAD.N, whose shares trade around a 15 percent discount to the offer.

Franklin Mutual Advisers, the third-largest Rite Aid shareholder, added virtually its whole position of nearly 30 million shares during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Franklin’s specific funds that added Rite Aid shares are known for investing in merger arbitrage opportunities, according to Morningstar. Franklin declined to comment.

Several deals with Chinese acquirers have encountered snafus, prompting fears about similar acquisitions. Ingram Micro IM.N is trading about 12 percent below a $6 billion bid from Chinese conglomerate HNA Group's unit Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co Ltd 600751.SS, amid questions about securing U.S. government approvals.

Outside of the United States, Swiss pesticides maker Syngenta SYNN.S is trading at around an 18-percent discount to an offer from state-owned ChemChina. The deadline for shareholders to accept the deal was recently pushed back to allow for regulatory approvals.

Another recent acquisition bid in the agricultural sector may present an opportunity.

U.S. seed company Monsanto MON.N last month turned down a $122-per-share offer from Germany's Bayer BAYGn.DE, but sources have told Reuters that Monsanto has left the door open to a possible deal.

Nonetheless, Monsanto shares are trading at $107, 14 percent below the initial offer.","Investors may be more wary about deals closing after regulatory opposition scuttled several major mergers in recent months.

7,"Dec 6, 2015",Reuters,GE calls off Electrolux appliance deal amid U.S. antitrust fight,"STOCKHOLM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Electric on Monday walked away from a $3.3 billion agreement to sell its appliances business to Sweden’s Electrolux, terminating the deal after months of opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators.

GE GE.N said it would pursue other suitors for its century-old appliance unit but declined to say who they might be.

“The appliances business is performing well and GE will continue to run the business while it pursues a sale,” the company said in a statement.

Shares of Electrolux, which sought to double its U.S. sales with the purchase, tumbled on the news, and the company said it will now focus on developing existing brands such as Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan and could look at other acquisitions.

The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit in July asking a judge to stop the deal, arguing that it would push appliance prices up by 5 percent. Electrolux, GE and larger competitor Whirlpool WHR.N make up more than 90 percent of major kitchen appliances sold to homebuilders, according to the lawsuit.

“This deal was bad for the millions of consumers who buy cooking appliances every year. Electrolux and General Electric could not overcome that reality at trial,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Gelfand of the department’s Antitrust Division.

This has been a year of megadeals but also a year of aggressive deals killed by equally aggressive U.S. antitrust authorities.

Dead deals include Comcast's CMCSA.O bid to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N, Sysco's SYY.N plan to buy US Foods, Thai Union's plan to buy Bumble Bee tuna and Applied Materials' AMAT.O scrapped plan to merge with Tokyo Electron 8035.T.

More mergers are under review including two insurance deals, Aetna's AET.N deal for Humana HUM.N and Anthem's ANTM.N planned merger with Cigna CI.N, along with a deal between Baker Hughes BHI.N and Halliburton HAL.N and Staples' SPLS.O merger with Office Depot ODP.O.

Electrolux shares fell 13.4 percent to 207 Swedish crowns, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock on Monday. They earlier touched a 14-month low of 203.2 crowns. GE closed 0.4 percent lower at $30.37.

FUTURE OF ELECTROLUX

The acquisition of GE’s appliance business would have seen Electrolux leapfrog Whirlpool as the world’s biggest appliances maker, strengthening its position in North and South America.

“We’re disappointed but we’re certainly not defeated,” Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told a conference call.

He said the firm would “continue to have a strong, robust M&A (mergers and acquisitions) process”, without elaborating.

Some analysts suggested McLaughlin might decide to leave in the face of the deal collapse.

“I’m not sure how much he will enjoy staying on now that what might have been his last deal won’t go through,” Handelsbanken Capital Markets’ Karri Rinta said.

With his family having returned to the United States several years ago, speculation has been rife McLoughlin, who has been CEO for almost five years and imported manufacturing practices from the auto industry to boost profitability, could soon leave.

McLoughlin said in a statement he remained committed to Electrolux and would continue as CEO.

In 2014, Electrolux made around 33 percent of its 112 billion crowns ($13.2 billion) of sales in North America against around 35 percent in Europe.

Before the GE deal was announced, Electrolux had been looking to buy into growth in emerging markets, a strategy it may now revisit.

The Swedish firm said GE had asked it pay out a termination fee of $175 million that was part of the transaction agreement.

It said fourth-quarter results would include about 175 million crowns of transaction and integration costs and would be hit by about 225 million crowns of costs arising from a bridge facility intended to finance the deal.","“The appliances business is performing well and GE will continue to run the business while it pursues a sale,” the company said in a statement.

8,"Jun 25, 2015",,Big winner from Obamacare ruling: Health care stocks,"President Obama wasn't the only one cheering Thursday's Supreme Court ruling in favor of Obamacare. Investors were too.

Health care stocks surged on the news. Hospitals were the biggest winners. Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped over 12%, making it the top gaining stock of the day. The company runs 80 hospitals in the U.S. and over 400 outpatient facilities.

HCA Holdings (HCA), which runs 165 hospitals, soared 8.8%, and Universal Health Services (UHS), which has 235 centers, popped over 7.5%.

In a major win for the Obama administration, the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision that the Affordable Care Act subsidies would stand. The subsidies will survive for eligible Americans living in states with their own exchanges and those residing in the 34 states that use the federal exchange.

Related: 6.4 million keep their Obamacare subsidies

The ruling means that 6.4 million Americans will get to keep their Obamacare subsidies. Investors see the ruling as a major win for hospitals because more of their clients will have insurance, which should make hospitals more profitable.

Hospitals are often the default option for people without health insurance, but since Obamacare kicked in, hospitals have seen their shares of uninsured patients drop.

""Most hospitals have had rising margins the past few years from Obamacare,"" says Fred Weiss, a portfolio manager at Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management who covers health care. ""So if they were making 12% margins, now they make 16%. That's 30% more profits.""

Other winners: Outside of hospitals, the stocks of insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) rallied over 2%. estors welcomed the news that the individual insurance market will remain intact.

Health insurers Humana (HUM) and Aetna (AET) soared even more on talk that Aetna is seeking to acquire its rival. Humana stock ended the day over 7% higher.

Overall, health care was by far the top performing sector of the stock market on Thursday. In fact, it was the only sector in the S&P 500 to end the day with gains.","Health care stocks surged on the news.

9,"Jun 29, 2015",TheStreet,3 Health Care M&A Deals and How Billionaire Investors are Playing Them,"The health care industry is bursting with opportunity right now, perhaps especially on the M&A front. Billionaire investors aren't missing out.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The health care industry is bursting with opportunity right now, perhaps especially on the deal front. Billionaire investors aren't missing out.

The U.S. Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling on Thursday rejecting a challenge to the use of federal subsidies in the Affordable Care Act wasn't just a win for President Obama. It also bodes well for the health care sector and its investors in what has already been a strong run in recent months.

The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) - Get Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund Report, which tracks the health care companies listed on the S&P 500, gained more than 20% in 2014. It has climbed an additional 10% year-to-date.

Mergers and acquisitions are among the main forces driving the sector, and last week's ruling is expected to intensify health care M&A activity. Novartis (NVS) - Get Novartis AG Sponsored ADR Report got the ball rolling on Monday with the announcement of a deal to buy biotech company Spinifex.

Billionaire investors and hedge fund managers like Bill Ackman and Larry Robbins are among those enjoying the benefits health care's stock market run and profusion of deals. And they stand to make even more. (Average investors can follow along at BillionairesPortfolio.com, which provides insights into sophisticated hedge fund analyses and strategies, tracks billionaire health care M&A bets and helps average investors to do the same.)

Here is a look at three potential M&A deals and how the billionaires are playing them.

1. Zoetis - Valeant

WSJ reported on June 25 that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) has approached Zoetis (ZTS) - Get Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS) Report regarding a potential acquisition. Should the deal come to life, potentially no one will be happier than Bill Ackman.

The billionaire at the helm of Pershing Square has major stakes in both companies. As per his most recent holdings disclosure, Ackman's top position is Valeant, of which he holds 19.5 million shares. He also has a sizable investment in Zoetis, with 41.8 million shares.

Pfizer (PFE) - Get Pfizer Inc. Report spun off Zoetis in 2013. The animal health care company caught Bill Ackman's eye in 2014, and in November, his fund disclosed an 8.3% stake in the firm. He has since maneuvered to secure Ackman's Pershing Square space on the Zoetis board and pressured the company to cut costs, including laying off as much as 25% of its workforce.

Though Ackman waited until early 2015 to invest directly in Valeant, he has had a relationship with the company for quite some time and in 2014 teamed up with it in an ultimately failed bid to acquire Botox maker Allergan (AGN) - Get Allergan plc Report. In May, he called Valeant the next Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) - Get BRK.A Report (BRK.B) - Get Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B Report.

A potential Valeant-Zoetis transaction appears to be in the earliest of stages, but it isn't the first or last bid we'll see from Valeant. The company completed the acquisition of specialty pharmaceutical company Salix in April, CEO Michael Pearson told Bloomberg in May that the firm has been and will continue to make acquisitions.

Other billionaires could get a boost off of a Valeant-Zoetis merger as well. Andreas Halvorsen, Steve Mandel and Larry Robbins have stakes in Valeant, and George Soros has invested in Zoetis.

2. Anthem - Cigna

A merger between Anthem (ANTM) - Get Anthem, Inc. Report and Cigna (CI) - Get Cigna Corporation Report would have an enormous impact on the health insurance industry. And as eager as Anthem seems to be to take over Cigna, Cigna isn't having it.

On June 20, Anthem made a $184 per share bid for Cigna and confirmed that the two had been in talks for quite some time. Cigna rebuffed the proposal the next day, calling it inadequate and not in the best interests of its shareholders.

Anthem reiterated its commitment to its bid on June 22, and CEO Joseph Swedish said in a statement that combined, the companies ""will generate approaching $2 billion in synergies with two years post close and at least $17 adjusted earnings per share by 2018.""

Should the two sides come to an agreement on deal terms, Larry Robbins will score a big win. The Glenview Capital manager, who was one of the first Wall Street heavyweights to bet on Obamacare, has stakes in both companies.

As per his latest holdings disclosure corresponding to the end of the first quarter, Robbins holds 4.9 million shares of Anthem. He also has nearly 1.8 million shares of Cigna.

It is worth noting that Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates has small positions in both companies as well.

3. Aetna - Humana

According to a June 25 Bloomberg report, Aetna (AET) is closing in on the acquisition of Humana (HUM) - Get Humana Inc. (HUM) Report. The potential deal between Anthem and Cigna intensified discussions, and Aetna is said to have made a formal bid last week.

But there are other players in the mix.

Cigna has also approached Humana with an offer, and Anthem has previously expressed interest as well. According to Bloomberg, however, Humana prefers the bid from Aetna.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) - Get UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Report, the largest health insurer in the United States, could also make a bid to buy Aetna, which may nix the Humana deal.

Should the Aetna-Humana deal prevail, Larry Robbins would again be a major beneficiary. Humana is one of his top positions, and as of the end of the first quarter, he owns more than five million of its shares. He also has 3.5 million shares of Aetna.

Robbins isn't alone in recognizing the potential value of Humana, which is a leader in the Medicare Advantage market. Leon Cooperman initiated a new position in the company during the first quarter of 2015, and Andreas Halvorsen and Ray Dalio are shareholders as well.

Dalio also owns over 100,000 shares of potential Aetna acquirer UnitedHealth.

13,"Sep 14, 2016",The Motley Fool,How Monsanto Wrangled a Win-Win Deal Out of Bayer,"After months of drama, German chemicals giant Bayer (OTC:BAYR.Y) announced that it and Monsanto (NYSE:MON) have agreed on terms of a merger at $128 per share. The $66 billion deal will create a global giant that represents one-third of all farm inputs, from seeds to crop protection. Make no mistake though, this deal is not without controversy, and there's no easy path to approval from regulators. For Bayer, it may take just as much work getting shareholders of both companies to sign off the union as it will take getting the deal past regulators.

Still a low-ball offer

For all the sound and fury generated by Monsanto that Bayer's previous offers undervalued the biotech, the agreed-upon price -- the fourth bid the German company made for its U.S. counterpart -- is only $0.50 per share higher than the last one. It may be that the $2 billion breakup fee Bayer has offered to pay Monsanto if the merger doesn't go through was the deciding factor in the board of directors' decision to accept the offer, one that's below the $130- to $140-per-share level management had reportedly deemed acceptable.

Bayer is the second biggest producer of crop protection chemicals behind Syngenta (NYSE: SYT), which Monsanto once tried to acquire but which instead agreed to be bought by China National Chemical. Together, Bayer and Monsanto will be the global leader in seeds and will account for one-third of all global crop inputs. The deal will push Bayer's crop science division from representing 30% of total revenues to about half, a significant restructuring of its business that may not sit well with its investors.

Until Bayer began pursuing Monsanto, it had been shedding assets that were not essential to its primary pharmaceutical business as it transformed into a life sciences company. It shed its plastics business, Covestro in an IPO, as well as its diabetes care business, and it recently announced the sale of its dermatology business. The announcement in May that it wanted to buy Monsanto caused some large shareholders to call the move an ""immediate destruction"" of shareholder value and to complain that the $122-per-share offer price was too high. It would also hit Bayer's credit rating, as it will be financing the deal mostly with debt, and it already carries a heavy load.

It's not much better on Monsanto's side, as investors -- though supportive of a buyout, as the stock had lost about a third of its value from highs of $125 in 2014 -- were reportedly looking for a price closer to $140 than below $130 a stub.

The middle ground between the two extremes that Bayer chooses looks as though it will appease no one, but Monsanto might hold an ace in its hand.

The $2 billion question

Although their businesses don't overlap much, they may still face antitrust hurdles, as the industry will be consolidated in fewer hands. As noted, Syngenta is being acquired by ChemChina in a $43 billion deal, while Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DD) are in the midst of their own $130 billion merger of equals.

According to ETC Group data, Bayer-Monsanto will own 29% of the global seed market, Dow-DuPont will own 21%, and Syngenta-ChemChina will own 9%. In pesticides, the breakdown is 24%, 23%, and 16%, respectively.

The Justice Department has proved to be a harsh critic when significant concentration occurs in an industry, stopping Halliburton from taking over Baker Hughes, Aetna from acquiring Humana, Anthem from buying Cigna, and most recently, John Deere from buying Monsanto's precision planting technology.

The concentration that will occur is certain to worry regulators, which is why the $2 billion breakup fee is important. While Bayer says the high figure represents its confidence that the deal will go through, Monsanto is assuredly looking at it as a windfall to finance its future growth should the merger fail. In context, the breakup fee is equal to almost all of Monsanto's full-year 2015 profits of $2.3 billion.

In short, it's something of a win-win scenario for the biotech. Although the purchase price is below what it would prefer, it still represents a 44% premium to where its stock was trading, and it has the backstop of a big breakup fee if the deal is quashed.","After months of drama, German chemicals giant Bayer (OTC:BAYR.Y) announced that it and Monsanto (NYSE:MON) have agreed on terms of a merger at $128 per share.

15,"Nov 21, 2016",Reuters,Anthem argues Fortune 500 will not suffer from Cigna deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anthem Inc ANTM.N and the U.S. Justice Department dug in their heels on Monday in court over whether the lower prices the health insurer expects to negotiate after buying smaller rival Cigna Corp CI.N are an efficiency that benefits customers or an antitrust violation.

The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo

In the first phase of what could be a two-stage trial, a lawyer for Anthem argued that the $45-billion deal, which was announced more than a year ago, would create a new, bigger insurer with the power to push down prices that it would pass onto customers.

But the Justice Department argued that any cost cuts would come from Anthem using its clout in the market to force hospitals and doctors to work for less.

“Efficiencies don’t count if the only way you get them is more market power,” the Justice Department’s attorney Jon Jacobs said in opening statements.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia may opt to block the proposed deal if she decides it will mean higher prices for consumers or that it hurts suppliers. The Justice Department asked her to declare the deal illegal under antitrust law.

The Justice Department’s Jacobs argued that the deal would also lead to fewer companies selling health insurance to big, nationwide employers that need a broad network of services.

Fewer companies usually means higher prices for these big companies, and Anthem’s lawyer Christopher Curran took issue with that idea. “The notion that these Fortune 500 companies are going to be victimized here ... is not realistic,” Curran said in court.

Curran also argued that the Justice Department had failed to consider the new online private exchanges where corporations allow employees to choose from multiple insurers.

Judge Jackson noted that the major insurance companies were the ones in the exchanges and asked: “How’s that the answer to the problem?”

The Justice Department’s Jacobs noted the tough competition between the companies, referring to an Anthem document. “It offered its sales force a bounty if they took business away from Aetna or Cigna,” said Jacobs.

The trial is expected to end by the end of the year.

The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop the $45-billion purchase of Cigna and Aetna Inc's AET.N $33-billion planned acquisition of Humana HUM.N, arguing that such consolidation among the largest health insurers would be anti-competitive.

Anthem attempted to make the case that it was not truly a national insurance company because it is only in 14 states.

Joseph Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, the largest member of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, testified that he would be inclined to assist another so-called blue plan land a national contract in a way it would not help one of the other major companies.

“If a blue plan reaches out to me to give help, I’ll give help,” Swedish said.

Anthem shares closed up 1.5 percent at $137.36, while Cigna shares fell 1.2 percent to close at $137.08.","The office building of health insurer Anthem is seen in Los Angeles, California February 5, 2015.

18,"Jan 23, 2017",USA Today,Aetna-Humana $37B merger blocked over fear it would harm consumers,"Kevin McCoy

USA TODAY

This news story has been updated.

A federal judge Monday temporarily blocked the proposed $37 billion mega-merger between health insurance industry giants Aetna and Humana, ruling that the transaction would reduce competition for consumers.

Although the antitrust decision can be appealed, the outcome could have significant ramifications on how older Americans purchase government Medicare and private Medicare Advantage coverage in the rapidly changing U.S. healthcare market, as well as on the options available to individuals who don't have employer coverage.

The ruling marks a significant setback for the companies, which in July announced the proposed deal to create the largest seller of Medicare Advantage plans, covering more than 4.1 million seniors. Humana could get a $1 billion breakup fee from Aetna if the deal ultimately falls through.

""In this case, the government alleged that the merger of Aetna and Humana would be likely to substantially lessen competition in markets for individual Medicare Advantage plans and health insurance sold on the public exchanges,"" U.S. District Court Judge John Bates wrote in his 156-page ruling. ""After a 13-day trial, and based on careful consideration of the law, evidence, and arguments, the court mostly agrees.""

The judge based his decision enjoining the merger on evidence of ""overwhelming market concentration figures"" the merger would generate, plus findings of head-to-head competition between Aetna and Humana that would be eliminated if the deal were finalized.

The decision represents legal vindication for the Justice Department, which was joined by eight states and the District of Columbia in opposing Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna's proposed takeover of Louisville, Ky.-based Humana during the Obama administration. Eight states and the District of Columbia joined the federal action.

Aetna, Humana face federal antitrust lawyers in court

The companies contended the deal would not lessen competition. They also said their complementary strengths in technology and relationships with health care providers would benefit consumers. But, calling those arguments ""unpersuasive,"" Bates's ruling concluded that federal regulation would be insufficient to keep the merged firms from raising prices or cutting benefits.

The judge also ruled that neither new health insurance competitors nor business divestitures the companies proposed to address antitrust concerns would replace competition eliminated by the merger.

Additionally, Bates concluded that Aetna tried to ""leverage"" the company's continued participation in federal Affordable Health Care Act exchanges in exchange ""for favorable treatment from DOJ regarding the proposed merger.""

The judge cited court records in which CEO Mark Bertolini and other Aetna officials suggested the company would withdraw from the exchanges if the Department of Justice sued to block the merger with Humana.

""This is persuasive evidence that when Aetna later withdrew from the 17 counties, it did not do so for business reasons, but instead to follow through on the threat that it made earlier,"" the judge said in his ruling. He added that internal company emails and other records show that Aetna ""tried to conceal from discovery in this litigation the reasoning behind their recommendation to withdraw"" from the exchanges.

""Today’s decision is a victory for American consumers — especially seniors and working families and individuals,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder, the current head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in an official statement. ""Millions of consumers have benefited from competition between Aetna and Humana, and will continue to benefit, because of today’s decision to block this merger.""

In response, Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said ""we're reviewing the opinion now and giving serious consideration to an appeal, after putting forward a compelling case"" in the non-jury antitrust trial heard by Bates in December.

Humana did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

""I would not bet my money on the companies winning an appeal,"" said Thomas Lang, an antitrust law specialist and a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the Haynes and Boone law firm. ""Judge Bates wrote a thorough and well-reasoned opinion ... where he carefully examined the parties own internal ... documents and evidence, as well as carefully considering the econometric evidence offered by each side’s economic experts.""

Aetna (AET) shares closed down more than 2.7% at $119.20. Shares of Humana (HUM) finished more than 2% higher at $205.02.

Antitrust trial over Anthem-Cigna merger begins

Another big antitrust case is still pending. That one is a $48 billion deal between Indianapolis-based Anthem and Connecticut-headquartered Cigna, two other members of the ""Big 5"" U.S. health insurance companies.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson presided over last year's antitrust trial of Anthem's plan to acquire Cigna. She is expected to issue a ruling later this month.

The opposing legal positions in the Aetna-Humana case focused on markets and competition.

Obama administration takes aim at corporate mergers, inversions

Citing health insurance markets in 364 counties across 21 states, government lawyers argued that the companies' combined concentration in private Medicare Advantage would rise above presumptive legal levels. They also cited similar findings for public health care exchanges in 17 counties across three states.

Aetna and Humana contended that the government defined the markets too narrowly. Post-merger concentration would remain within presumptive legal limits if the relevant product market included both Medicare and Medicare Advantage benefits.

Additionally, the companies said potential entry of health insurance rivals, and the proposed sale of Medicare Advantage business to Molina Healthcare, an unrelated insurer, would make anti-competitive harm unlikely.

Siding with the government, Bates ruled that merger would likely lessen Medicare Advantage competition in all 364 complaint counties and in public health insurance exchanges in three Florida counties.

The judge also agreed with the government's contention that Aetna said it had withdrawn from competing in 17 counties during 2017 ""specifically to evade judicial scrutiny of the merger.""

20,"Jan 12, 2017",MarketWatch,Opinion: How repealing Obamacare will be Trump’s Iraq,"Donald Trump is very smart — just ask him — so he’s a quick learner. He’s not even inaugurated as president, and already he’s picked up the basic steps George W. Bush followed to disaster in Iraq. Brilliant!

As the president-elect’s party stumbles toward repealing the Affordable Care Act without replacing it, elements of an Iraq-style disaster are in place: Selective use of intelligence, the belief that a populace eager to lose health insurance (and Medicare too!) will toss flowers at invaders, the absence of a post-invasion/Obamacare-repeal strategy, and an unwillingness to admit the real cost of solving the problem, meaning it will take far more to clean up the resulting mess.

'Grow Up, Donald': Biden's Response to Trump Tweets

Other than that, Republican approaches to Iraq and Obamacare are totally diff!

Let’s take the similarities in turn.

Selective intel

W. believed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons for a reason: Not because the Central Intelligence Agency said so, but because Bush wanted to. His team chose the Saddam-has-nukes analysis out of piles of conflicting intelligence for that exact reason.

So too does Trump pull a handful of health-insurance anecdotes he half-understands, or tweets out of context, when an avalanche of information shows Obamacare’s success.

Wyoming Sen. John Barasso insists different sources made up numbers of 20 million people gaining insurance under the law, presumably after fabricating climate change. Republicans want Obamacare gone, so any pseudo-data (like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s long-discredited claim that more people lost insurance under ACA than gained it) is instantly given credence — within the GOP bubble.

“Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116% hike in Arizona,” Trump tweeted Jan. 4. “Massive increases of Obamacare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess.”

However, other numbers are out there — and they’re comprehensive, not anecdotal.

Inflation in group-insurance rates has fallen by 55% since the law took effect, saving companies $5,000 per worker. And individual-insurance prices, which did spike for 2017 by 22% before subsidies offset the hikes, had risen only 2% and 4.4% the prior two years, falling in many states.

Projections by the Urban Institute say the GOP’s repeal-and-replace plans would cost 30 million people coverage.

Analyses by Standard & Poor’s show insurers’ losses on individual insurance under the law narrowing, with more issuers likely to break even this year.

The Urban Institute says Obamacare repeal would cost hospitals $1.1 trillion in uncompensated care over 10 years. Now that’s an Iraq-scale fiscal screwup.

Next to this, Trump riffing on Twitter counts as much as Dick Cheney making stuff up on Meet the Press in 2003.

No plan for afterward

Trump’s party says we should defund insurance for 20 million people — repealing a law that also includes taxes that keep the Medicare trust fund from going broke during Trump’s presidency. And, they think telling people after the next election how they’ll replace it is a great idea.

Deleting an entire health system, and saying maybe you’ll replace it by 2019, is not unlike firing the Baath Party hacks who ran Iraq’s civil service and belatedly realizing that chaos would ensue. In fact, it’s exactly the same.

They’ll throw flowers!

The most out-of-touch argument about Iraq was that Iraqis were so democracy-hungry they’d welcome U.S. soldiers, and the interim regime they installed, with flowers. Unless flowers are made of lead and shaped like bullets, Baghdad mornings were filled with scents other than native yellow chamomile.

Here now comes the contingent of reporters finding shock and awe among red-state voters that Trump will actually cut their health insurance, just as he promised, and who are not delighted. Since two-thirds of people who would lose coverage if ACA is repealed have a high school degree or less, according to the Urban Institute, the impact on communities where Trump won the election is plainly large.

Unwillingness to spend what it takes, costing more in the long run

Notoriously, the Bush administration sacked chief economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, for admitting the war would cost as much as $100 billion — the real number ultimately became $5 trillion.

Obamacare opponents say individual-insurance markets are death-spiraling because UNH, +0.43% Cigna CI, +1.22% , Humana HUM, +0.62% , Aetna US:AET and ANTM, +0.84% are losing about $1.5 billion on non-group policies this year. This gap is uncloseable, the argument goes, although tax subsidies for employer-sponsored group insurance cost $216 billion last year.

It’s gibberish: You could cover insurers’ individual-market losses, driven largely by a single group of drugs, double subsidies to let insurers cut deductibles (aka provide better insurance), and individual policies would still cost the government a quarter of what group-insurance subsidies will. Repeal without a replacement creates that trillion-dollar bill to care for newly uninsured people.

Here’s the best part: Slothful habits like those behind Iraq characterized W.’s presidency, leading to catastrophic policies elsewhere, and Trump is much lazier. As he slouches toward an appointment in health-care Samarrah, remember: It won’t be the last time.","He’s not even inaugurated as president, and already he’s picked up the basic steps George W.

21,"Dec 30, 2016",MarketWatch,"Why health insurers won’t cover this $300,000-a-year rare disease drug","Alison Willis Hoke’s twin sons were among the 12 boys in a key clinical trial that helped get Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.’s Exondys 51 approved, as the first treatment for the rare degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

But her health insurer will only cover the more than $300,000-a-year drug for DMD patients who can walk, a blow for her wheelchair-bound sons.

“The thought of this drug being taken away from my boys after everything they’ve been through over the last five years is astounding,” she said. “It’s really alarming.”

Willis Hoke’s story exemplifies the new bind for patients with DMD and their families. Until this fall, the often-deadly disease had no treatment. But highly variable insurance coverage could keep this new treatment out of reach for many patients.

It also signals a bumpy path forward for drugmaker Sarepta SRPT, +3.86% . Health insurers have cited the controversial approval history of the drug, also known as etiplirsen, as rationale for constraints on coverage, or for not covering the drug at all.

““The thought of this drug being taken away from my boys after everything they’ve been through over the last five years is astounding. It’s really alarming.”” — Alison Willis Hoke, mother of twin boys who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy

That has led to a reversal in Sarepta’s once-soaring shares and raised questions about its recently-cemented status as a biotech darling.

What happens next could test patients as well as the company. Willis Hoke does not expect Sarepta to continue providing Exondys 51 to her boys for free, forever. But her family can’t afford to pay for the pricey drug out-of-pocket, and she says she “can’t fathom” taking her boys off the medication.

Five of the top 13 commercial health insurers in the U.S. will cover the drug, according to a report last week by J.P. Morgan analyst Anupam Rama.

Of that number, some have more stringent requirements than simply meeting the genetic profile for the drug, which studies show about 13% of DMD patients do.

Aetna Inc. US:AET and Humana Inc. HUM, +0.62% both have an “ambulatory requirement,” so patients must be able to walk. Aetna has also imposed an under-14 age requirement to start the medication, according to Rama.

Many other insurers simply won’t cover it. Anthem made the earliest and most prominent such decision, with Kaiser Foundation Group also not covering the drug.

Doctors 'De-Prescribing' for Over-Medicated Patients

Exondys 51 was approved under an accelerated pathway, which is intended to speed up treatments for diseases like DMD. The FDA looked at what’s called a “surrogate endpoint” in making its decision, or an increase in the protein dystrophin in patients treated with the drug.

Critics, including an advisory committee that recommended against approving the drug, zeroed in on the small patient population involved in the research — just 12 boys — and certain aspects of how the clinical trial was designed.

See: More bad news for those that have this disease with no treatment

But members of the patient community advocated strongly and loudly for the drug’s approval, with many telling stories about how Exondys 51 had made a difference in their children’s lives.

Other insurers’ policies on the drug appear to still be in the works, Rama said.

There are a couple of reasons health insurers could be making these decisions, Rama said, including its high cost, the “contentious/flawed nature” of the FDA’s approval, the FDA label on Exondys 51 that says its benefit hasn’t yet been established, a lack of protest from medical providers and current development of potentially cheaper treatment alternatives.

Sarepta relied upon improvements in walking for patients on its drug in applying for FDA approval. Many DMD patients can no longer walk when they reach their teenage years. Indeed, nearly all of the company’s clinical trials enrolled ambulatory patients, according to Rama’s report.

The Exondys 51 application was based on “a large significant advantage” of over 100 meters on a six minute walk test for boys treated with Exondys 51, according to the FDA advisory committee’s report. The effect was consistent and held across several analyses and a FDA follow up, the report said.

DMD, which by and large affects boys, first manifests in early childhood as muscle weakness and degeneration and gets worse over a patient’s life. Those symptoms are particularly dangerous once they extend to the heart and respiratory systems.

Patient advocates say Sarepta’s drug can improve those symptoms.

Christine McSherry, co-founder and executive director of the DMD nonprofit the Jett Foundation, says she’s seen “subtle but significant changes” in her son with DMD since he started on Exondys 51 in 2014.

She calls the drug — which is covered by her insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield — a “miracle in my son’s life.”

Jett, 21, had been snoring since he was young, but now he was breathing better at night, she said. He was able to hold himself up while sitting, could reach over to pat the dog or reach his desk. He began using his hands more, opening bottles and cans, and began requesting pencils to use at college.

These changes “are not necessarily being picked up as a clinical endpoint. They’re being picked up at home from people who are with these young men seven days a week,” she said. “I’m going to notice if my son is eating a submarine sandwich, or a regular sandwich, more readily.”

Willis Hoke’s sons have been on Exondys 51 for more than five years. But her Excellus BlueCross BlueShield health plan requires patients first complete an “unassisted” six minute walk test of at least 200 meters.

Her twins “are never going to get up and walk and jump out of their chair,” she said, making the test impossible.

But she says her sons should still qualify for the drug, which is “going to extend these boys’ life expectancies and improve and maintain their quality of life.”

“I just cannot imagine, and it scares me to death, what the decline is going to be if the drug is taken away from them,” Willis Hoke said.

Related: At $300,000 a year, Sarepta’s new drug is considered a steal

The way criteria for coverage varies between health insurers has also been a source of frustration for Willis Hoke. And while she says she understands criticisms of the FDA’s Exondys 51 approval, ultimately she doesn’t believe approval was a mistake, and thinks that further data — which the FDA has required of Sarepta — will support that.

Willis Hoke and others have called the refusal to give the drug to DMD patients who can’t walk discrimination.

“Just because I can’t walk doesn’t mean the drug won’t benefit my other muscles. Your heart is a muscle too, and your lungs rely on critical muscles to function,” writes one Change.org petition by a DMD patient with an Excellus plan. “By restricting access to this medicine, I’m being denied a drug that could help me live a longer life. It is not only immoral and unethical, but should be illegal.”

McSherry estimates that 60% of DMD patients are not ambulatory, a number based on her team’s research.

Still, the ability to walk varies by patient. DMD patients who hadn’t taken steroids stopped walking around age 10 on average, while steroid use for more than five years stopped walking at around age 12, one 2015 study found.

Willis Hoke says that right now she’s in fight mode and hasn’t been able to think about what happens if her sons can’t get covered for Exondys 51. But she’s willing to make big changes, if it comes to that.

“Major life changes would have to occur to keep them on the drugs,” Willis Hoke said. “Because I just can’t fathom taking them off the drug.”","But her health insurer will only cover the more than $300,000-a-year drug for DMD patients who can walk, a blow for her wheelchair-bound sons.

22,"Aug 19, 2016",MarketWatch,"Opinion: Aetna, Obamacare and health insurers’ 10 dirty secrets","Whom do U.S. health insurers think they’re kidding?

The answer, of course, is: everybody.

Industry giant Aetna US:AET just said it is dropping most of its Obamacare plans. That follows similar moves by rivals. It’s dealt a serious blow to the Affordable Care Act and its goal of universal health care in America. Conservatives I know say they are celebrating — somewhat prematurely — “the death of Obamacare.”

Aetna cited losses on the plans as its reason. News reports since then say there’s another factor at play. The company may be engaging in political retaliation against the Obama administration for trying to block its merger with rival Humana HUM, +0.62% .

Here’s how shares of major health insurers have fared since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law March 23, 2010. FactSet

But that’s not the only thing the industry isn’t being candid about.

Here are 10 other things they won’t tell you.

1. They’re a scam. The entire health-insurance industry consists simply of taking our money — and then paying us back around 80 cents on the dollar, or less. That’s all. They add no value, and serve no other purpose. This is not Apple AAPL, +0.81% , or Amazon AMZN, -0.05% , or even your local restaurant. These companies do not innovate, take risks or create meaningful new products or services. They shuffle money — at a high cost. You and I are paying about 30% too much for our health insurance each year just to support these middlemen. It’s an undeclared private tax.

2. They are terrible gatekeepers. The one alleged justification for private health-insurance companies is that, because they have stockholders, they will be vigilant about preventing fraud and waste, and keeping down the cost of health care. The actual outcome? Here in America we have the highest health-care costs in the world. Oops.

3. They waste money hand over fist. Aetna said it has lost $430 million on Obamacare plans during the first two years. During that same time the company spent $23 billion on administration, marketing, paperwork, junkets, bonuses and other overhead. That’s a ridiculous 26 cents for every dollar it paid out in actual benefits. Yes, really. That included $32 million, over two years, paid to Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Bertolini. He spent more than $200,000 last year just in his personal use of the company’s private jets. How many nurses, and doctors, and lab technicians — people who actually provide health care — spent $200,000 last year taking private jets on vacation?

4. They’re booming. You remember all that talk about Obamacare and “socialism” and Saul Alinsky and the “government takeover” of the health-insurance industry? Since Obamacare passed in March 2010, Aetna’s stock has rocketed 270%, with dividends reinvested. Rivals Cigna CI, +1.22% and Humana have risen about the same. (The benchmark S&P 500 Index has increased 99%.) UnitedHealth Group UNH, +0.43% is up a staggering 371%, meaning a dollar invested at the advent of Obamacare is worth almost $5 today. “Socialism” never looked so profitable.

5. They avoid sick people. The No. 1 way to make a profit in health insurance isn’t somehow to provide “better” insurance or “better” service for customers. It’s to sell health insurance to people who won’t need it. That’s why these companies fall over themselves to try to sign up young white-collar professionals with no kids. That’s why they always avoided people with “pre-existing” conditions. Aetna said it was losing money on Obamacare because it had too many sick customers who wanted to use their insurance. Bummer.

6. They deny treatment whenever they can. It’s not malice — it’s math. Private health insurers only make money if they keep payouts below premiums. Actually, because of their high costs, they need to keep the payouts way, way below premiums. And that means if their customers do get sick, they have every incentive to try to deny treatment. Massachusetts just had to pass a law making health insurers cover treatment for chronic Lyme disease, because the insurers had refused. The insurers, naturally, fought the law tooth and nail.

7. They own the government. Insurers, especially health insurers, are terrific sources of money for politicians of all stripes. That includes direct campaign contributions, and those lucrative lobbying jobs on offer for former politicians, and staffers, who’ve behaved like good little trained spaniels when allegedly serving the public. The Center for Responsive Politics, a think tank that follows money in politics, says that since 1998 the industry has spent at least $440 million on lobbyists, plus another $75 million in direct campaign contributions.

8. Their talk about “freedom” and a “government takeover” is cynical propaganda to protect their scam. Every other free country in the developed world has universal health care. That’s not just counting socialist countries like Denmark and Sweden. It’s counting countries like Germany and Japan and Australia and Canada and Singapore and Great Britain. What do they know that we don’t? When Obamacare passed in 2010, a money manager told me he was despairing of “socialist” America and he was buying Swiss francs, because at least Switzerland remained a capitalist country. Hey, dummy: Switzerland has universal health care. Actually, double dummy: Obamacare was modeled on the system used in … er … Switzerland.

9. The “market” for private health insurance is inherently flawed. You and I can’t shop for health insurance the way we shop for a vacation or a computer or a car. We don’t know if we’re going to get sick. Medical treatments are so complex and specialized, there’s no way for us to know what they “should” cost. We can wait till we need one to buy it. And the price of buying the wrong laptop, or no laptop, isn’t death.

10. Actually, “socialized medicine” already works in America — and people love it. Medicare covers 54 million of us over the age of 65, and it is a full-blooded, bona fide, Marxist-Leninist, communist, Soviet, government-run health-insurance plan. Any politician opposed to “socialized medicine” should be required to run for re-election on a platform of abolishing Medicare and replacing it with private health insurance. Good luck with that. Oh, and compared to private health-insurance companies, it is staggeringly efficient. Medicare’s administrative costs last year were $9 billion, compared with benefits of around $640 billion. That’s around 1.4 cents for every dollar paid out. Private insurers: around 20 times as much.","It’s dealt a serious blow to the Affordable Care Act and its goal of universal health care in America.

The SEC names pricing terms, technical specifications and milestone payments as three examples of non-public information that are commonly granted protection under CTOs. CTOs are temporary, and the company requesting the CTO must specify the date on which the CTO will expire.

Performance since Clinton announced on April 12, 2015 through July 25, 2016, the start of the Democratic National Convention: +2.70%

HCA Holdings is a for-profit health care services company that operates hospitals and other related facilities.

Clinton has pledged to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Adjustments to make the system work better, and the possibility of more states accepting Medicaid expansion under incentives supported by Clinton, would likely benefit hospitals. This is especially true of HCA Holdings, which has numerous hospitals and surgery centers in states like Florida, Georgia and Tennessee that have thus far held out on accepting Medicaid expansion.

Performance since Clinton announced on April 12, 2015 through July 25, 2016, the start of the Democratic National Convention: +11.63%

The company would benefit from a Clinton presidency on two fronts: in the Obamacare exchanges (which under her would likely be fixed), and in Medicare Advantage (a substitute for parts of original Medicare that is likely to expand). Especially if its planned acquisition of Humana (HUM) - Get Humana Inc. (HUM) Report goes through.

SolarCity (SCTY)

Performance since Clinton announced on April 12, 2015 through July 25, 2016, the start of the Democratic National Convention: -52.84%

Clinton's campaign platform includes setting a series of national goals, including 500 million solar panels installed and generating enough renewable energy to power every home in America, to curb climate change and promote clean energy. If she were to make progress, it would mean good things for companies in solar. Elon Musk's SolarCity has already executed projects for government clients in states like Connecticut, California and Maryland.

Renewable Energy Group produces biofuels and develops renewable chemicals.

Clinton is a proponent of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires a minimum blend of biofuels in gasoline. She has also pledged to reduce American oil consumption by a third, which would almost certainly be good for biofuels. Ames, Iowa-based Renewable Energy Group could get a boost from such initiatives.

Aecom provides professional engineering, consulting and project management services for infrastructure projects.

It pulled in more than 5,000 government contracts in 2015 valued at $2.6 billion, and if Clinton were able to boost federal infrastructure investment as much as she pledges to on the campaign trail, it might very well see that increase. The former secretary of state has said she would increase investment by $275 billion over a five-year period and create a $25 billion infrastructure bank to support critical infrastructure improvements.

Performance since Clinton announced on April 12, 2015 through July 25, 2016, the start of the Democratic National Convention: -18.01%

Goldman Sachs has been a sore spot for Clinton the campaign trail, with her foes on both the left and the right critiquing paid speeches she gave at the firm. Even though the former first lady has said she would get tough on Wall Street in the White House, it is unlikely she would really go after Goldman and others all that hard.

Clinton has said that as president she will support raising the federal minimum wage to $12 and that where it can be raised to $15, it should be. While such a maneuver would mean many companies would have to increase wages, it would also put more money into consumers' pockets. According to an analysis from S&P Capital IQ, large retailers like Walmart and competitor Target are well-positioned to absorb wage hikes and would benefit from lower-income consumers having more to spend in their stores.

On the campaign trail, Clinton has repeatedly called for increased surveillance, in the wake of the June Orlando attack demanding an ""intelligence surge"" to bolster capabilities. As a U.S. senator, she voted for the Patriot Act in 2001 and its reauthorization in 2006. S&P Capital IQ's analysis predicts Clinton's increased focus on surveillance would be a boon for L-3 Communications.

In April 2016, U.S. Steel filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission alleging Chinese steel producers conspired to fix prices, steal intellectual property and falsify import labels to avoid tariffs. Clinton is likely to be more aggressive than President Obama in enforcing trade laws and leveling the global playing field, tripling the number of trade enforcement officers, cracking down on currency manipulation and standing up to abuses. This would give U.S. Steel a hand.

AEP, which generated 14% of its power from its merchant coal fleet in 2014 but 62% from its regulated plants, would have to spend more money to replace its generating assets under the Clean Power Plan, which would in turn be added to its rate base.

31,"Jan 18, 2017",Benzinga,"Exclusive: Recro Pharma CEO Talks Meloxicam, Alleviating Investor Concerns","Recro Pharma Inc (NASDAQ: REPH) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that engages in the development of products for the treatment of serious acute pain. The company's lead product candidate is called meloxicam, which is an IV intravenous product for relief of serious pain that is nonaddictive.

Benzinga had the opportunity to speak with Recro Pharma President and CEO Gerri Henwood who has been with the company since it was founded in 2008.

Where The Company Stands Today

Henwood explained that the company has finished both of its phase 3 pivotal studies of its meloxicam therapy. On July 26, 2016, the company reported its first of two pivotal trials met its primary endpoint and the company followed up with a second report on November 28, 2016.

Today the company is completing a big safety study requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration involving 700 patients. Henwood said she expects to complete and roll in patients by the end of March or the first week in April and will then have a 30-day follow-up visit after which the data will be compiled.

A new drug application is expected to be filed before the end of the summer.

How Recro Pharma Fits In

Henwood said opioids will always play a role in pain medication, but doctors performing every day surgeries would prefer not giving their patients opioids.

""So, if we think about orthopedic procedures, which there are a lot of, those are often same day surgeries nowadays because you've got your knee replaced or your hip replaced, but you're being sent home in many cases to have your physical therapy and other things dealt with at your home,"" the executive explained. ""The doctor is worried about getting you covered for serious pain during that first 24 hours, so you had the surgery, you left the hospital, you've got to get through that night into the next morning, by which time usually your stomach is a little bit more settled, you might be able to take and keep down the pain medications they gave you, but they don't want you to suffer through the worst period of pain, that first 12 to 24 hours after surgery.""

Henwood continued that her pain medication is very useful for patients undergoing intra-abdominal procedures. Specifically, opioids slow the bowels down more than the surgery and this creates a new market for the company.

Meanwhile, Henwood said she has received ""very enthusiastic reactions"" for anesthesiologists and from surgeons about the number of patients they think would find this product to be very useful.

Alleviating Investor Concerns

Henwood was asked what investors biggest concerns are moving forward.

She answered that investors are always concerned that the FDA may introduce unexpected issues that surprises the market although the executive said she is not aware of any potential issues.

Another main concern stems from the uncertainty of how a product will get commercialized, what will the company's uptake be.

Potential Partnerships

Henwood noted that as part of any future launch process it will need to carefully consider many options, including the potential for partnerships or even acquisitions.

""I think that we recognize people could come our door with the disproportionate value proposition, and we'll have to pay attention to them on behalf of our shareholders and make sure that we're making careful, right decisions,"" she said. ""But I also think there is disproportionate value that can come from prudently taking commercial and fulfilling that and we, fortunately had the opportunity in a prior life that my last company to launch a product, yet it adopted, and that product and subsequent product that we licensed went on to do very, very well for shareholders.

""We would hope to have a similar opportunity here. Of course, we have to get through the approval process before we can have that. But we have said to investors that we need to be prepared to launch in any case because even if someone approach us we need to be able to drive value in any such equation by showing them how the map is for formulary adoption, how we would approach the market, what the market research how about product potential in a very detailed way.""

Henwood added that in the meantime, her main focus is preparing the company for its future even if nobody comes to the door. Nevertheless, she did say it is ""a little bit early"" for any U.S. partnering potential discussions as the company has not yet received the kind of safety data that potential partners would want to see beforehand.","Recro Pharma Inc (NASDAQ: REPH) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that engages in the development of products for the treatment of serious acute pain.

32,"Nov 18, 2016",RealClearPolitics,"Mark Blyth: ""Global Trumpism"" And The Revolt Against The Creditor Class","Mark Blyth is a Scottish political scientist and a professor of international political economy at Brown University. At an event on November 9 at Brown's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, he spoke about ""Global Trumpism"" -- a worldwide working-class backlash against harmful macroeconomic trends.



""What we have everywhere are creditor-debtor standoffs,"" he said. ""If you look at the states that really fell hard [for Trump] in the Rust Belt, it is economic. Now, if you recognize that simple fact, you can put Trump in there with Brexit.""



Blyth wrote more about Global Trumpism in this week's edition of Foreign Affairs.





MARK BLYTH: I wasn't surprised [by Trump's victory] at all. Many of you have sat here in this room with me and heard me speak about 'Global Trumpism' and various things like this. The first time I came out publicly and said I thought he would win was at a Watson event in May last year. I did an interview in Greece that went viral last year where I predicted both Brexit and Trump. And it is not because I have a clairvoyant crystal ball sitting on my desk, or I made a pact with Satan to see the future in a mirror, it is simply pretty obvious if you think about it in a more global way.



This is not a local event. Everything Professor Schiller said is true about this election, but Brexit happened. It is a left-wing version of this that brought us [the new government in] Greece. There is a shrinkage of center-party votes across the entire OECD. There's the collapse of left wing party votes, in particular, across Western Europe.



Coming up next, [Italian PM Mateo] Renzi is going to fail in the referendum coming up, which will cause a Constitutional crisis in Italy.



Shortly after that, we have the French election coming up. I would like to remind you of the following statistics. The lowest George W. Bush ever got as president in his approval rating was 29%. The president of France currently has an approval rating of 4%. And the National Front have nearly 40% of the intended vote. So even with the design of the French Constitution, which makes it very difficult, and you have to have a second round, etc. The most popular political party, by a factor of two in France is the National Front.



After that we have the German elections coming up. Merkel is vulnerable. How is all of this going to play out, and how is it all connected?



Here's a simple way of thinking about it: From 1945 until 1975, we targeted a particular economic variable called 'full employment.' And there's a thing called the Lucas Critique, which says that if you keep targeting something, people will game it. And they did. Unions gamed it, employers gamed it, and the result was inflation. And after a while, that inflation became painful. Painful enough that the people who were hurt by it --the creditor classes in these countries-- had to band together and form a market-friendly revolution. And they liberated finance, and they deregulated finance and they integrated the economies of the world. And they globalized labor such that labor could no longer demand that it gets its share of productivity. Because if you do, they'll move your job somewhere else.



And all of those trade agreements that were signed –which is inevitable and we can never roll back. You know you can go on the web and type in: “WTO text.” And you'll find that it is a very long 700-page legal agreement that took years to negotiate between corporate interests, lawyers, lobbyists, with very little input from civil society. The same is true of the EU's agreements on capital movements, the banking union, take your pick.



And there was a moment when people began to figure out, for the past 30 years, going from 1985 until now, huge amounts of money have been generated in the global economy. And as we know from the work of Thomas Piketty and others, most of it has gone up to a tiny fraction of the population. There has been a huge amount of growth, but hardly anyone has seen any benefit.



You don't have to go far to see this. Get off the East Side. Go to Northwest Providence, and walk into the neighborhoods which have check-cashing agencies, pawn shops, broken-down fix-your-mobile and networks you've never heard of stores, fried chicken joints. That's the reality for people here and in many, many countries.



So they're a bit fed up with this. And they've decided that any possible opportunity, whether it is Brexit, the Italian constitutional referendum, or anything, to basically give their elites notice: We've had enough of this. And that's what this is.



Now there's a macroeconomic underpinning to this one too, and that is that after we decided to target full employment for 30 years, we decided to target inflation for 30 years. I don't see why the Lucas Critique doesn't actually apply to that one too. And we've managed to create a world in which you can dump 13 trillion Euros into the global money supply through Quantitative Easing and other programs, and not see any inflation anywhere at all.



Here's your problem: When you levered up your banking system, and bailed it out, dumped it on the public purse and said you need to cut that terrible debt, when people's personal balance sheets are still bloated from all the credit they took on in the 2000s, and they don't have wage growth, and there's no inflation to ease the burden of the debt, the creditor fight harder to get their money back. There is the case of Germany vs. the rest of the Eurozone, whether it is the form of the creditor class vs. the rest of the debtor class. What we have everywhere are creditor-debtor standoffs. And those creditor-debtor standoffs take different forms.



For the left it takes the form of Podemos. For the right it takes the form of the National Front. And for Trump –which is a weird coalition-- which is of course sexist, and of course racist, and of course anti-immigrant, and all the rest of it. But one part of it, if you look at the states that really fell hard in the Rust Belt, it is economic.



Now, if you recognize that simple fact, you can put Trump in there with Brexit, you can put Trump in there with Jeremy Corbyn, you can put him in with all the rest of it.



And I'll leave you with one set of numbers that I found today, which is just an absolute for this whole thing. In 2015, Wall Street Bonuses, not regular compensation, bonuses, seven years after they were bailed out with the public purse, totaled $29.4 billion dollars.



Total compensation paid to every single person in this country who makes minimum wage totaled $14 billion. I'll stop there...



I think the Wall Street issue goes much deeper than this. If you download from WikiLeaks, the Podesta emails, and start searching for place names, something very interesting happens. One of the place names that comes up the most in Martha's Vineyard. Another one that comes up after that is Davos. Another one is Washington D.C., and then basically the distribution of real places where people actually live disappears into the tail.



We talk about the Democratic Party -- I don't know who that is. I know there's a bunch of people who have made very nice six-figure careers in D.C. bouncing from agency to agency, starting wars, getting promoted, never actually paying the cost for it, waiting for the next administration to give them a pay hike. You see a lot of that. If you spend any time in D.C., you'll bump into them all the time...



I'm not even sure who the Democrats are that are going to make this challenge, who the people that they are going to connect with, the social organizations. The movements, the youth. How do they touch them when they barely even only talk to each other and no one else on the way out to Martha's Vineyard or Davos to commune with the guys at Goldman who are funding the party?

21st Century Fox may be open to selling off many of its media assets amid troubles in its Sky Broadcasting acquisition and increased competition.

Disney was the first interested buyer, with Comcast and Verizon coming in about a week later.

21st Century Fox's stock has risen each time a new interested buyer was reported, leading to speculation a bidding war could break out.

Watch Fox's stock price move in real time.



At a Goldman Sachs hosted conference in September, 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said his company was fighting a two-front battle. One in the US against consolidating competitors like AT&T and Sinclair Broadcast Group, and the other in Europe for control of Sky Broadcasting.

The company’s fight for Sky Broadcasting has been delayed as anti-competition panels look into the deal. While Fox awaits the final decision on Sky, it isn’t willing to spend a lot of capital in the US to fend off its rivals, Murdoch said at the Goldman Conference. But, ""if we could [keep our rivals at bay] in other manners it’s something we’d be open to looking at,"" Murdoch added, according to a report from Variety.

Since Murdoch made that comment, another manner surely has opened up in the form of a bidding war for parts of the company. Disney, Comcast and Verizon have all shown their interests in purchasing parts of 21st Century Fox, and it looks as if Fox is willing to come to the table.

Disney was the first company to reportedly be interested in Fox

Disney is primarily interested in 21st Century Fox's film and entertainment assets, leaving behind the sports and news parts of its business to hopefully avoid anti-competition scrutiny. Disney owns its own broadcast company in ABC, and wouldn't be allowed to own two networks.

Disney is also reportedly interested in purchasing Fox's 39% stake in Sky Broadcasting, which would free Fox from its ongoing ownership battle.

Reports of Disney's talks with 21st Century Fox broke on November 6, and some speculated that the assets Disney was interested in could help boost the amount of content Disney would be able to offer in its recently announced streaming service.

Shares of 21st Century Fox spiked about 6% following the report that Disney was interested in parts of the company.

A week later, Comcast became interested

Comcast is interested in similar assets to Disney, focusing on the entertainment content and staying away from its news and sports assets.

Comcast’s rival, AT&T, has agreed to purchase Time Warner, which owns HBO and other entertainment channels, but the deal has run into a roadblock. The US Department of Justice wants the company to jettison parts of Time Warner to gain approval for the acquisition. Comcast’s interest in Fox may stem from its desire to acquire more content to keep pace with AT&T.

Buying Fox's entertainment assets would give Comcast more content to match its rival's acquisition of Time Warner, which owns HBO and other content channels.

Verizon joins the list of suitors

Verizon became interested in 21st Century Fox shortly after Comcast did, according to the Wall Street Journal. The wireless company could have also been spurred on by the willingness of Fox to sell and AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner.

Shares of 21st Century Fox are up 16.21% in the last month and the stock has risen each time a new interested buyer was reported. Shares are up 5.59% to $30.96 on Friday, leading to a market cap of $56.463 billion. Multiple interested buyers could lead to a bidding war for the company, while talks with each still seem to be in preliminary stages.

21st Century Fox is up 7.43% this year after all the reports of buyers.

1,"Feb 12, 2018",US News Money,Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Poised for Battle,"The merger and acquisition market in the media space is red hot at the moment, and recent reports suggest that it could soon get even hotter. Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is reportedly considering an effort to outbid Walt Disney Co. (DIS) for the movie studio and cable TV assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA), a move that could trigger a bidding war for Fox.

According to the Wall Street Journal, a previous bid by Comcast for Fox's assets was rejected by Fox not because of the price of the bid, but because of concerns regulators would block the merger. The Wall Street Journal now reports that Comcast's original offer for Fox's assets was in the low $60 billion range, about 15 percent higher than Disney's $52.4 billion bid that was accepted in December.

Now, people familiar with the situation say Comcast is considering taking another run at Fox by outbidding Disney. The news had Fox shares trading higher by more than 2 percent on Monday morning.

Ironically, a potential Comcast-Fox deal could hinge on the fate of another blockbuster media deal. CNBC reported last week that Comcast may be more likely to take another shot at a Fox deal if the merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) is ultimately approved. AT&T will have to defend the $85 billion deal in court after the Justice Department decided to sue to block the deal on antitrust grounds.

But even though Comcast may come back with an aggressive bid for Fox's assets, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Alan Gould says Disney will not lose a bidding war without a fight.

""We believe control of Hulu and Fox's international assets, especially Sky's European and Hotstar's Indian direct-to-consumer assets are strategically critical for Disney's planned entertainment streaming product, and Disney would likely counter if Comcast were to bid,"" Gould says.

""We don't know if Comcast will indeed bid, but at a minimum, we would think the prospects of a competitive bid should reduce the arbitrage discount investors are putting on Fox.""

The current value of the all-stock Disney bid is in the low $40s per share, and Comcast's reported bid for Fox is valued at around $46 per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N joined Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O on Wednesday in asking the judge hearing AT&T Inc's T.N antitrust case to strengthen an order aimed at keeping its data private if it is used at trial next year.

Disney and Fox have given data to the Justice Department that is being used to build a case against AT&T's bid to buy Time Warner Inc TWX.N. The companies say they fear that executives with AT&T, which owns satellite TV provider DirecTV, could inadvertently gain access to it during the trial.

The government sued last month to block the $85.4 billion acquisition, saying the deal could lead to higher prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers while hampering the development of online video. The trial is set to begin on March 19.

“The complex and competitive business relationships between Fox and defendants that make Fox wary of disclosing sensitive information in this lawsuit are nearly identical to those between TWDC (the Walt Disney Co) and defendants,” Disney said in its request.

Disney licenses its content to cable television companies and competes with Time Warner in creating content.

Judge Richard Leon, who is hearing the case at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, had given access to confidential information to the court, Justice Department lawyers and staff, service providers and AT&T and Time Warner’s outside counsel.

Disney said that it was making the same request made previously by Fox.

Fox had asked for permission to withhold certain sensitive information if it decided it was not relevant. It also wanted AT&T and Time Warner to tell Fox who will access the information and requested that any lawyer who handles the data be barred from working on matters involving Fox without their consent for two years.","Disney and Fox have given data to the Justice Department that is being used to build a case against AT&T's bid to buy Time Warner Inc TWX.N.

3,"Apr 2, 2018",Reuters,Murdoch's Fox could sell Sky News to Disney to appease UK regulator,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch has stepped up the pressure on Britain to approve his $14.5 billion bid for Sky SKYB.L by offering to sell or legally separate Sky News, seeking to allay concerns about the 87-year-old mogul's political influence.

Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt Disney Co DIS.N or become a legally separate business within the Sky group.

Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky it does not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the UK government and regulators.

Fox had already promised that Sky’s 24-hour news service would remain independent under the ultimate control of Murdoch, but critics, including some high-profile politicians, remain adamantly opposed due to Murdoch’s record of influence through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers.

The delay enabled U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.0 to gatecrash the deal in February by saying it would offer 12.50 pounds a share to buy Sky, compared with Fox's 10.75 pounds - although it has not yet made a formal bid.

As the Sky deal remained in regulatory limbo, Fox separately agreed to sell a string of assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, to Disney, potentially taking Murdoch out of the Sky equation.

Fox said on Tuesday its new concessions went beyond the steps that Britain’s media regulator Ofcom said would mitigate concerns about Murdoch’s influence.

The company, however, needs to persuade another regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the government.

“We have worked diligently with the CMA throughout its extensive review,” it said.

“In fact, we believe that the enhanced firewall remedies we proposed to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky News addressed comprehensively and constructively the CMA’s provisional concerns.”

MATCHING COMCAST?

Fox said it could legally separate Sky News within the wider Sky group, so it would operate independently with guaranteed funding for 15 years.

Alternatively, it said Disney had expressed an interest in acquiring the 24-hour news channel, whether or not Disney’s proposed acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox went ahead.

Fox senior vice president Gerson Zweifach said the solutions addressed all concerns about the transaction.

“We look forward to concluding this acquisition - finally - in a timely and expeditious manner,” he said.

Sky shares were up 0.9 percent at 13.09 pounds at 0906 GMT, above both the agreed offer from Fox and the proposed bid by Comcast.

Analysts at Liberum said Fox’s latest concessions should be enough to secure approval. They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

First, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focused on maximizing value for shareholders.

Separate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added.

A group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News.

The four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch’s record of influence.

The group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Fox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making “a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions”.","Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt Disney Co DIS.N or become a legally separate business within the Sky group.

4,"Dec 6, 2017",Markets Insider,"RBC: 21st Century Fox will keep going up as Disney acquisition talks simmer (DIS, FOXA)","REUTERS/ Eddie Keogh

Disney is reportedly in talks to buy 21st Century Fox's TV assets.

RBC analyst Steven Cahall breaks down the potential details of the deal and thinks 21st Century Fox will spin off the assets Disney isn't interested in.

21st Century Fox could grind higher as the details of the deal are worked out and announced, Cahall said.

Watch 21st Century Fox's stock price change in real time here.



It's looking like Disney could be the eventual buyer of 21st Century Fox's entertainment and TV business, but many of the details are unknown. No deal has yet been announced, but reports from CNBC citing unnamed sources are predicting an announcement as early as next week.

In a note sent out to clients on Wednesday, RBC analyst Steven Cahall tried to work out how a potential deal could spin.

""Assuming that Fox bonds don't travel, Fox could potentially spin off Fox News/Broadcast/FS1-2 etc. as 'Fox SpinCo' while leaving the rest of the assets and the debt for Disney to acquire,"" Cahall predicts.

Creating a spin-off company before selling to Disney could be a clean way for Disney and Fox executives to package the deal. Spinning off the assets Disney isn't interested in to form a debt-free company would provide a clean balance sheet for the Murdochs to do with as they please. They could continue to run the business as it's own entity, but would also be able to bring the assets under the News Corp umbrella or seek a separate buyer as the media industry leans toward forming big content conglomerates.

The so-called ""Fox SpinCo"" would have an estimated $2.8 billion in annual earnings before taxes, interest and amortization. The assets that would remain part of 21st Century Fox before Disney's acquisition, what Cahall calls ""RemainCo"" could pull in about $4.7 billion a year in earnings. Disney is reportedly interested in the business at an enterprise value of about $60 billion, which implies a 10.5 value to earnings ratio.

Combined, the RemainCo and Fox SpinCo assets would be worth about $37 per share, according to Cahall's estimates, which is about 11.6% higher than the company's current price of $33.15. Cahall said this means there is room for the company's shares to move higher after a deal is announced.

21st Century Fox has risen 32.2% over the last month as various reports about a potential sale have circulated. Shares have added another 0.49% on Wednesday after Cahall's report.

Cahall was sure to hedge his valuations of the company by saying the deal still has to be announced, then approved by regulators.

5,"Dec 14, 2017",Business Wire,"The Walt Disney Company to Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., after Spinoff of Certain Businesses, for $52.4 Billion in Stock","BURBANK, Calif. & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (“21st Century Fox” —NASDAQ: FOXA, FOX) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Disney to acquire 21st Century Fox, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios, along with cable and international TV businesses, for approximately $52.4 billion in stock (subject to adjustment). Building on Disney’s commitment to deliver the highest quality branded entertainment, the acquisition of these complementary assets would allow Disney to create more appealing content, build more direct relationships with consumers around the world and deliver a more compelling entertainment experience to consumers wherever and however they choose. Immediately prior to the acquisition, 21st Century Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed company that will be spun off to its shareholders.

Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of 21st Century Fox will receive 0.2745 Disney shares for each 21st Century Fox share they hold (subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities as described below). The exchange ratio was set based on a 30-day volume weighted average price of Disney stock. Disney will also assume approximately $13.7 billion of net debt of 21st Century Fox. The acquisition price implies a total equity value of approximately $52.4 billion and a total transaction value of approximately $66.1 billion (in each case based on the stated exchange ratio assuming no adjustment) for the business to be acquired by Disney, which includes consolidated assets along with a number of equity investments.

Popular Entertainment Properties to Join Disney Family

Combining with Disney are 21st Century Fox’s critically acclaimed film production businesses, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures and Fox 2000, which together offer diverse and compelling storytelling businesses and are the homes of Avatar, X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool, as well as The Grand Budapest Hotel, Hidden Figures, Gone Girl, The Shape of Water and The Martian—and its storied television creative units, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox21, which have brought The Americans, This Is Us, Modern Family, The Simpsons and so many more hit TV series to viewers across the globe. Disney will also acquire FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Fox Sports Regional Networks, Fox Networks Group International, Star India and Fox’s interests in Hulu, Sky plc, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group.

“The acquisition of this stellar collection of businesses from 21st Century Fox reflects the increasing consumer demand for a rich diversity of entertainment experiences that are more compelling, accessible and convenient than ever before,” said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. “We’re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we’re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings. The deal will also substantially expand our international reach, allowing us to offer world-class storytelling and innovative distribution platforms to more consumers in key markets around the world.”

“We are extremely proud of all that we have built at 21st Century Fox, and I firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace in what is an exciting and dynamic industry,” said Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox. “Furthermore, I’m convinced that this combination, under Bob Iger’s leadership, will be one of the greatest companies in the world. I’m grateful and encouraged that Bob has agreed to stay on, and is committed to succeeding with a combined team that is second to none.”

At the request of both 21st Century Fox and the Disney Board of Directors, Mr. Iger has agreed to continue as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company through the end of calendar year 2021.

“When considering this strategic acquisition, it was important to the Board that Bob remain as Chairman and CEO through 2021 to provide the vision and proven leadership required to successfully complete and integrate such a massive, complex undertaking,” said Orin C. Smith, Lead Independent Director of the Disney Board. “We share the belief of our counterparts at 21st Century Fox that extending his tenure is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and will be critical to Disney’s ability to effectively drive long-term value from this extraordinary acquisition.”

Benefits to Consumers

The acquisition will enable Disney to accelerate its use of innovative technologies, including its BAMTECH platform, to create more ways for its storytellers to entertain and connect directly with audiences while providing more choices for how they consume content. The complementary offerings of each company enhance Disney’s development of films, television programming and related products to provide consumers with a more enjoyable and immersive entertainment experience.

Bringing on board 21st Century Fox’s entertainment content and capabilities, along with its broad international footprint and a world-class team of managers and storytellers, will allow Disney to further its efforts to provide a more compelling entertainment experience through its direct-to-consumer (DTC) offerings. This transaction will enable Disney’s recently announced Disney and ESPN-branded DTC offerings, as well as Hulu, to create more appealing and engaging experiences, delivering content, entertainment and sports to consumers around the world wherever and however they want to enjoy it.

The agreement also provides Disney with the opportunity to reunite the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool with the Marvel family under one roof and create richer, more complex worlds of inter-related characters and stories that audiences have shown they love. The addition of Avatar to its family of films also promises expanded opportunities for consumers to watch and experience storytelling within these extraordinary fantasy worlds. Already, guests at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World Resort can experience the magic of Pandora—The World of Avatar, a new land inspired by the Fox film franchise that opened earlier this year. And through the incredible storytelling of National Geographic—whose mission is to explore and protect our planet and inspire new generations through education initiatives and resources—Disney will be able to offer more ways than ever before to bring kids and families the world and all that is in it.

Enhancing Disney’s Worldwide Offerings

Adding 21st Century Fox’s premier international properties enhances Disney’s position as a truly global entertainment company with authentic local production and consumer services across high-growth regions, including a richer array of local, national and global sporting events that ESPN can make available to fans around the world. The transaction boosts Disney’s international revenue mix and exposure.

Disney’s international reach would greatly expand through the addition of Sky, which serves nearly 23 million households in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy; Fox Networks International, with more than 350 channels in 170 countries; and Star India, which operates 69 channels reaching 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other countries.

Prior to the close of the transaction, it is anticipated that 21st Century Fox will seek to complete its planned acquisition of the 61% of Sky it doesn’t already own. Sky is one of Europe’s most successful pay television and creative enterprises with innovative and high-quality direct-to-consumer platforms, resonant brands and a strong and respected leadership team. 21st Century Fox remains fully committed to completing the current Sky offer and anticipates that, subject to the necessary regulatory consents, the transaction will close by June 30, 2018. Assuming 21st Century Fox completes its acquisition of Sky prior to closing of the transaction, The Walt Disney Company would assume full ownership of Sky, including the assumption of its outstanding debt, upon closing.

Transaction Highlights

The acquisition is expected to yield at least $2 billion in cost savings from efficiencies realized through the combination of businesses, and to be accretive to earnings before the impact of purchase accounting for the second fiscal year after the close of the transaction.

Terms of the transaction call for Disney to issue approximately 515 million new shares to 21st Century Fox shareholders, representing approximately a 25% stake in Disney on a pro forma basis. The per share consideration is subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities arising from the spinoff and other transactions related to the acquisition. The initial exchange ratio of 0.2745 Disney shares for each 21st Century Fox share was set based on an estimate of such tax liabilities to be covered by an $8.5 billion cash dividend to 21st Century Fox from the company to be spun off. The exchange ratio will be adjusted immediately prior to closing of the acquisition based on an updated estimate of such tax liabilities. Such adjustment could increase or decrease the exchange ratio, depending upon whether the final estimate is lower or higher, respectively, than the initial estimate. However, if the final estimate of the tax liabilities is lower than the initial estimate, the first $2 billion of that adjustment will instead be made by net reduction in the amount of the cash dividend to 21st Century Fox from the company to be spun off. The amount of such tax liabilities will depend upon several factors, including tax rates in effect at the time of closing as well as the value of the company to be spun off.

The Boards of Directors of Disney and 21st Century Fox have approved the transaction, which is subject to shareholder approval by 21st Century Fox and Disney shareholders, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, a number of other non-United States merger and other regulatory reviews, and other customary closing conditions.

But more to the point, they discuss what they think makes Disney's (NYSE:DIS) massive 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) acquisition a potential exception to that rule.

A full transcript follows the video.

This video was recorded on Dec. 19, 2017.

Mac Greer: We have a great email from a listener. The listener writes, ""The panelists on Motley Fool Money were generally very happy about the news of Disney buying assets from Fox. On the other hand, I've heard several experts on your show talk about how they disapprove of inorganic growth, M&A in particular. I'm having a bit of difficulty in reconciling these two points of view. Can you shed some light? Thanks. Happy holidays, Brajcich."" Happy holidays right back at you!

Ron Gross: Yeah, absolutely. That's a great question. Let's define organic or inorganic growth for a second. Organic growth is when a company is able to grow just based on the assets they possess. It has an ongoing business, and it's doing well enough that it grows each year. When you have to go out and buy growth through an acquisition, that's where it gets dicey, because most acquisitions, I think it's fair to say, destroy value, don't add value. So when it came to Disney, I think on the whole, we thought this was a great idea. But he does have a point, because Disney was struggling there a little bit, so they bought their way out of it to a certain extent by getting in certain great assets like the sports and other content. So I think the question is fair, and we have to keep an eye on this particular deal to make sure it adds value and doesn't destroy it. Which, on the whole, I think it will. But it's certainly not a gimme, and we have to watch it.

Greer: But you have Pixar, you have Marvel, and you have Lucasfilm. That turned out OK.

Gross: Yeah, those are amazing and [laughs] for sure OK. But as we said, when businesses are struggling and they try to buy their way out of that struggle, very often, more so than not, it's a mistake that destroys value for shareholders. And you need the right CEO in there, the right capital allocator, to make those tough decisions. I think Iger is probably that guy, which again, I think it's one of the reasons that we like this deal. But keep an eye out, because it's an expensive deal, a lot of money changing hands, a lot of moving parts, integration is key to success when it comes to an acquisition of this size. And, as the email says, trying to buy growth can be fraught with trouble.

Jason Moser: Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head there. When you look at Disney's growth rates over the last five years annualized, the top-line revenue number grew at about 5.5% annually over the last five years. Not terribly impressive, but they were able to really bring a lot of that down to the bottom line. Earnings growth was close to 13% annualized. For me, yeah.

You mentioned Pixar and Marvel and Lucasfilm. Part of it is looking at the track record. We have the benefit of hindsight, looking at Bob Iger's track record, and saying, yes, there are risks that come with consolidation and acquisition, but we also know that he's done a pretty good job with it so far. And he has three really good examples that he can shine a light on and say, ""Look, we made this work."" So we have to at least give him the benefit of the doubt there. It's also not a company that solely grows via M&A.

I'll use another example of a business that, to date, has done really well, and I think it's because the gentleman behind it has been very good at the M&A that this business has participated in, and that's Middleby. Middleby has been in the commercial oven business. That's not the biggest market opportunity in the world. Selim Bassoul, I think, recognizes that part of the avenue for growth for them was going to be making a lot of little acquisitions of regional distributors and bringing them into their family. And as it stands, he's done a tremendous job. But that's a business where I think, looking forward, you have to start being a little bit concerned about, maybe, have they done about all they can really do? I don't know. But more acquisitions, the numbers are going to work against you at some point. So it's something to keep in mind, for sure.

Gross: I'll just add that, when looking at this, is it a good deal or a bad deal, a good decision or not, it's, why was the acquisition done? Are you in a fragmented industry where it makes sense to consolidate some of that and bring things in house, as they did at Middleby, let's say, with the acquisition of Viking, for example? Or is the company struggling and going to try to acquire their way out of the problem by completely pivoting in a different direction, a new business, or something they don't have competence in? And they're just trying to throw money at a problem? That's where it gets a little more dicey.","On the other hand, I've heard several experts on your show talk about how they disapprove of inorganic growth, M&A in particular.

Murdoch's Fox FOXA.O has agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own, but the deal has become bogged down in regulatory investigations. In the meantime, Fox has agreed to sell assets to Disney in a follow-on deal, including Sky.

Murdoch helped to launch Sky in 1990 before his holding was cut to around 40 percent during its flotation in 1994. He sought to buy the company back eight years ago but failed during a high-profile media and political scandal. Here is a timeline:

Mid 2010 to mid 2011

A phone-hacking scandal erupts at Murdoch-owned tabloid News of the World, culminating in the closure of the paper and the appearance of Murdoch before parliament, which he describes as the “most humble day of my life”.

July, 2011

News Corp withdraws its bid for the 61 percent of BSkyB it does not own, in the face of widespread hostility.

December, 2016

Fox strikes a $14.6 billion deal to buy Sky to unite Murdoch's media empire across two continents and help it take on rivals like Netflix NFLX.O in the battle for viewers.

March, 2017

The British government asks broadcast regulator Ofcom to decide if the deal is in the public interest.

Britain says it intends to subject the deal to a further, in-depth investigation after finding it risks giving the media mogul too much power over the news agenda.

September 12, 2017

Britain’s culture secretary throws the deal into doubt when she asks regulators to consider whether Fox would uphold standards, having not previously raised such concerns.

September 14, 2017

Britain confirms it will refer Fox’s bid for Sky to a lengthy regulatory investigation.

November, 2017

Comcast CEO Brian Roberts takes a London taxi to a Sky store, and is impressed with the products and how people talk about Sky - cab driver included.

December 14, 2017

Walt Disney Co DIS.N strikes a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Murdoch's Fox for $52.4 billion in stock, including its holdings in Sky.

January 23, 2018

9,"Jan 17, 2018",The Motley Fool,Why 2017 Was a Year to Remember for The Walt Disney Company,"Some investors might look at The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) stock chart for 2017 and shrug it off as a forgettable subpar performance. The stock tumbled as much as 7.5% lower in the fall and closed the year at a gain of just 3.2%. Shareholders missed out on a fantastic period for the general market, where the S&P 500 market barometer rose 19.4%.

However, that would be a shortsighted analysis. The House of Mouse actually laid a lot of groundwork for a better future last year.

Two game-changers

Disney made two moves in 2017 that will leave a huge footprint on the company's long-term prospects.

First, a multiyear partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) got the boot as Disney declined the option to renew it when the contract expires at the end of 2018. Instead, Disney bought out the remaining 66% of Major League Baseball's BAMTech platform that it didn't already own. That technology already serves up streaming video services for the MLB, the NHL, and many other sporting leagues. In the spring of 2018, Disney will launch a BAMTech-based streaming service for all kinds of sports under the ESPN banner, followed by a full-on entertainment solution at the start of 2019.

The expiring Netflix deal only covered the U.S. market, but Disney will probably roll out its replacement services on a global level. After waffling on the issue for a few weeks, the company also confirmed that the entertainment service will take over all of Disney's film brands. ""It will have the entire output of the studio: animation, live action at Disney, including Pixar, Star Wars and all the Marvel films,"" said CEO Bob Iger at an industry conference last September.

This is huge news for Disney investors. The company is taking much closer control over its powerful content catalog, in a world where streaming media looks like the clear-cut future of entertainment in general. Assuming that the BAMTech platform can deliver a consumer-friendly experience at a reasonable cost, and that Disney's compelling brand name lets the new service hit the ground running, this announcement will be remembered as the start of a long-term cash cow operation.

Second, but no less important, Disney is buying most of 21st Century Fox's (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) operations in a $52 billion blockbuster deal.

If that acquisition passes regulatory muster, Disney will absorb one of its largest and most important Hollywood rivals along with a generous assortment of cable TV networks. Buyouts have played a large part in Disney's rise since Michael Eisner got the ball rolling in 1995. The $19 billion buyout of Capital Cities, which owned the ABC network and 80% of ESPN, was followed by the billion-dollar additions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. All of these deals have delivered mighty contributions to Disney's top and bottom lines, and I see no reason why the Fox deal should be different.

What's next?

It's hard to say whether the Fox buyout or the commitment to a company-owned streaming solution will make the larger impact on Disney's business in the long run. It's fair to say that the BAMTech move should result in a stronger return on the much smaller original investment, though.

And don't forget that the Fox acquisition should give Disney majority ownership of the popular Hulu service. Overall, the company moved far deeper into a credible digital future last year. Don't expect Hulu and BAMTech to move Disney's business needle much in 2018 or 2019, but you have to start somewhere.","Some investors might look at The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) stock chart for 2017 and shrug it off as a forgettable subpar performance.

10,"Dec 16, 2017",The Motley Fool,Why Isn't Walt Disney Paying Cash for the 21st Century Fox Deal?,"There are many ways to skin a cat, and even more options when you're financing a $52.4 billion buyout. In the case of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) acquiring most of 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA), it's a pure stock-swap transaction that prints out 515 million new Disney shares for the benefit of Fox shareholders. What does this mean, and why will Disney dilute the holdings of existing stock owners by a staggering 34%? Let's figure it out.

The numbers

Disney's current share count stands at 1.51 billion stubs. The Fox transaction will require 515 million new shares, giving the Fox cohort 25% control over the merged companies. At that point, a couple of things will happen:

A basket of Fox assets, including name-brand properties like Fox News, Fox Sports, and the Fox broadcast network, gets spun out as a brand new, entirely separate company. The new and substantially slimmer Fox company will operate under the same two-class stock structure as the old one, making no significant changes to the company's ownership.

Disney will invest $10 billion in share buybacks between now and the closing of the Fox deal, also committing to another $10 billion buyback over the following 24 months. At today's prices, that works out to retiring 12% of Disney's current market cap, or roughly 180 million shares. Seen from a different angle, that would be 35% of the new Fox shares going back into the vault.

Mind you, big buybacks are nothing new for Disney. The company hasn't issued any new shares in nearly a decade, but the buyback policy is coming on strong. In fact, Disney tends to spend pretty much all of its available free cash flows on stock repurchases, with or without stock-based buyouts on the table:

What's wrong with cash deals?

Other content deals, like the $4 billion Lucasfilm buyout, were paid chiefly in cold, hard cash. Since Disney likes to hold its cash balances pretty steady in the neighborhood of $4 billion-$5 billion, the company has taken on a lot of debt in recent years. Long-term debt balances have raced from less than $13 billion to more than $23 billion in five short years. Tapping the brakes on that long-term trend sounds like a healthy idea.

The combination of a large, stock-based buyout and a generous buyback program sends mixed messages. Buybacks usually happen when a company's management believes that its share are undervalued, making it hard to find a better way to invest excess cash than into the stock itself. On the other hand, share-based buyouts tend to follow when the buyer's shares are riding high.

By my analysis, the rising buyback budgets say more about Disney's own valuation analysis than the decision to tap into the stock's equity value. Disney could have made an opportunistic play for Fox two years ago, when its own stock was riding an adrenaline high from the first Disney-produced Star Wars movie, and Fox was headed in the opposite direction.

The decision to fund this buyout entirely with Disney stock doesn't strike me as an attempt to exploit a skyrocketing stock price. Instead, it seems to be based on a desire to keep the debt balance under control.

As a Disney shareholder, I'm OK with that. The Fox deal should add enough business value to make up for this 34% share dilution in short order.","There are many ways to skin a cat, and even more options when you're financing a $52.4 billion buyout.

The Analyst

Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser maintains a Buy rating and unchanged $35 price target on Fox's stock and a Sell rating on Disney's stock with an unchanged $83 price target.

The Thesis

The on-again-off-again talks between Disney and Fox could be confirmed as early as Thursday.

The market concentration among content packagers will increase but the market for premium video content will remain ""relatively fragmented,"" according to Wieser. The impact to the advertising segment of the market will likely be ""limited"" as a combined Disney-Fox entity will still be smaller in the U.S. market than NBCU and Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAB).

Even if Disney and Fox reach an agreement not to compete against each other in sports, they will still have to individually compete with a plethora of other players.

Disney could acquire control of Fox's international content and FX network for inclusion in its own over the top streaming platform.

Fox could benefit from a renewed focus on a smaller asset base, financial leverage and changes to U.S. media ownership rules. The combined Disney-Fox entity will still result in margin erosion for Disney, Wieser said.

12,"Nov 7, 2017",TheStreet,Disney CEO Bob Iger Would Forever Secure His Legacy With Fox Deal,"Bob Iger has a chance to leave a lasting imprint on the world's large entertainment company should it acquire most of Rupert Murdoch's Fox.

The notion that Walt Disney Co. (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report may buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report television and film studios is all about Netflix Inc. (NFLX) - Get Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Report , the streaming service that has almost single-handedly shaken the global media business.

But it's also about Disney CEO Bob Iger.

CNBC on Monday, Nov. 6, reported that Fox has been in talks with Disney to sell its TV production business as well as the 20th Century Fox movie studio along with cable networks such as FX and the National Geographic Channel and international assets including its 39% stake in Sky plc. According to CNBC, the deal wouldn't include the Fox broadcast network, its sports programming group or the Fox News Channel.

Such a transaction would remake both companies, forever changing history's view of Rupert Murdoch. For a man who built a global media empire from his father's modest newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, the sale of much of Fox to a longtime rival would be a chilling epitaph. He also would be leaving sons Lachlan and James with a much smaller empire than might have been expected.

But for Iger, who is scheduled to relinquish his position atop Disney in July 2019, the deal would be as transforming and significant as his ambitious and highly successful acquisitions of Pixar Animation Studios Inc., Marvel Entertainment Inc. and Lucasfilm Ltd. Iger, of course, was promoted to CEO in 2005, succeeding Michael Eisner, who was ousted in a very public shareholder revolt led by Roy E. Disney, the founder's nephew who died in 2009.

Iger arguably has been slow to adjust to cord-cutting and the online distribution model leveraged by Netflix, which recently surpassed 109 million subscribers worldwide. While even smaller rivals such as CBS Corp. (CBS) - Get CBS Corporation Class B Report have rolled out direct-to-consumer streaming services, Disney remained tethered to pay-TV, loath to potentially cannibalize ESPN's position atop the industry. The sports juggernaut costs $7.86 per pay-TV subscriber, SNL Kagan reported in March; the next closest cable network is Time Warner Inc.'s (TWX) TNT at $2.09 per subscriber.

But ESPN has been bleeding subscribers, its rolls having dropped to around 87 million from a peak of more than 100 million in 2011, according to Nielsen NV (NLSN) - Get Nielsen Holdings Plc (NLSN) Report . In year's past, ESPN accounted for more than 50% of the company's net income. But those days are over.

Before Disney shares rose 2% on the CNBC report on Monday, the stock had fallen 5.4% this year. Meanwhile, the rest of the market has surged; the S&P 500 index has gained 15.7% in 2017.

Shares of Disney increased about 1% on Tuesday.

Though Iger wouldn't admit it, Disney's announcement in August that in 2019 it will launch an entertainment streaming service featuring Disney studios along with Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar content is all about catching up with or cutting down Netflix. That Disney needs until 2019 to put such a service together gives credence to the criticism that Iger was caught napping.

As had been expected, Iger in August affirmed that Disney will launch a new ESPN-branded streaming service early next year that will include some 10,000 live events a year. Whether or not such a service convinces some consumers to jettison their much higher priced cable subscription, which also includes ABC and Disney Channel, is unclear.

Yet if CNBC's reporting is correct, it shows that Iger may be willing to spend billions of dollars to acquire a breadth of film and TV content that should be able to counter and perhaps even eclipse Netflix. Owning 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight would give Disney a studio that produces the kind of mass-market feature films that Disney abandoned in recent years to focus on franchise blockbusters with worldwide appeal.

Fox's films also win Oscars, as evidenced by ""Hidden Figures"" and ""The Revenant."" And Fox owns the Avatar franchise, at the heart of the Disney theme park addition that opened in Orlando in May.

Fox declined to comment on the CNBC report. Disney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Billionaire media mogul John Malone mused a year ago that Disney should consider selling ESPN, arguing it had become a drag on its finances and stock price. Buying Fox's TV and film assets might not solve all of ESPN's problems, but it would like take much of the pressure off the company's cable TV group.

For Iger, his time at Disney may finally be coming to a close. Making one last all-encompassing, company-altering deal would be the crowning achievement for one of the most celebrated media executives in recent memory.

Chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger speaks next to the character of Minnie Mouse at the unveiling of her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni -

Disney suffered a rare rebuke from its shareholders last week when a 52 percent majority opposed the compensation of Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote that could encourage the board to tweak the pay package.

ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, estimated that if Iger hits maximum goals the package would make him the 12th-highest paid U.S. CEO on an annual basis in the past 10 years.

Disney did not put a total value on Iger’s pay package.

Markus Hansen, senior research analyst at Vontobel Asset Management, which had 2.4 million Disney shares at year-end, praised Iger’s performance but said the firm voted against the compensation with the view the four-year pay package could be too easy to collect.

Under a contract extension through 2021 Iger could receive the full value of $100 million in stock awards tied to a deal to buy film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O even if Disney's total shareholder returns are middle-of-the-pack versus other big companies.

While the metrics are not unusual, the feedback the board should take from the shareholder vote is that “the amount is large, so maybe a reduction in the amount and an increase in the performance targets” would be in order, Hansen said.

Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager for pension overseer Florida State Board of Administration, said it voted its 2.2 million Disney shares against the compensation on similar concerns. It also had concerns about the lack of a clear succession plan after Iger leaves.

“You hate to see a payout of that magnitude for short-term performance,” Williams said. He said however that a reorganization Disney announced on Wednesday had assuaged some succession concerns.

To be sure, some investors would be pleased if Iger earned the top number. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said he voted 150,000 shares for Disney’s compensation plan because other media companies also pay well and Iger’s Fox deal looks smart.

“If he succeeds, then you pay the guy,” Gerber said.

Compensation consultant Brent Longnecker said the vote could spur the board to re-examine Iger’s performance goals, though he did not expect major change.

“I assume they won’t ignore it,” Longnecker said of the vote.

Asked about the pay estimate and investor concerns, a Disney spokesman referred to comments after the vote from Aylwin Lewis, chair of the company’s compensation committee.

Lewis had said the board will take the vote result under advisement for future CEO compensation. Iger is “imperative” for Disney to keep as it absorbs Fox, Lewis said, with the CEO’s value illustrated by a total shareholder return of 414 percent during his tenure. Iger became CEO in 2005.

Iger made $36.3 million in the twelve months ended Sept. 30.

The analysis by ISS Analytics done at the request of Reuters showed the agreement could yield Iger roughly $423 million over four years if he hits all goals, or $274 million as the base case targeted by the board.

The analysis assumed that the Fox deal closes early next year and excluded elements such as stock appreciation. After the deal closes, Iger’s target annual pay would be about $55 million per year including salary and some stock awards.

That amount could rise based on performance goals, ISS found.","Disney did not put a total value on Iger’s pay package.

17,"Dec 28, 2017",The Motley Fool,How Roku Could Win Big From the Disney-Fox Deal,"When Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) released its first-ever quarterly results as a publicly traded company last month, shares skyrocketed more than 50% in a single day -- and investors rightly rejoiced. After all, Roku trounced Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom lines, led by what management described as the ""rapid adoption"" of its advertising, audience development, and content-distribution services. While its player sales climbed a modest 3.8%, to $67.3 million, platform-segment revenue jumped 137%, to $57.5 million.

But with the help of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX)(NASDAQ:FOXA), the budding media-streaming company could be poised for even more impressive gains going forward.

The deal that changes everything

More specifically, two weeks ago, Disney announced it had agreed to acquire most of Fox's assets in a mammoth all-stock deal worth roughly $52.4 billion. As part of the agreement, Fox will spin off its Fox Broadcasting network and stations -- including Fox News, Fox Business, the Big Ten Network, and its FS1 and FS2 sports stations -- into a newly listed company.

Then, assuming Disney closes on its end by the middle of 2018, as planned, the House of Mouse will be the proud new owner of the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television Studios, and Fox's remaining cable and international TV businesses. That includes the rights to properties like Avatar, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Deadpool, regional sports networks, National Geographic, a 39% stake in European satellite provider Sky, Star in India, and a controlling stake in video-streaming site Hulu.

Investors should keep in mind that Disney already owns not only its namesake film studios, TV channels, and parks and resorts, but also Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, ABC, an 80% stake in ESPN, and 50% of A&E Networks.

The Fox side of the equation

How does this industry-shaping deal benefit Roku?

First, after Fox spins off its selected assets, it will be positioned primarily as a play on the live news and sports industries. But Fox also opted to maintain its ownership stake in Roku, which amounted to roughly 7% of the total company prior to Roku's initial public offering in September. To be clear, that stake was likely diluted in the initial public offering (IPO), but it's still a notable vote of confidence.

It also shouldn't be a complete surprise. When asked in an interview with TheStreet last month whether traditional TV players have underestimated the shift in ad spending to streaming services, Roku CEO Anthony Wood replied: ""Yes -- not all of them. Fox's leaders I think understand, but many of them don't.""

In short, Fox should serve as an able partner and investor in Roku's longer-term success.

A boost from Disney

Second, earlier this year, Disney investors cheered as the company unveiled plans to roll out two streaming services -- an ESPN-branded multi-sport video service in 2018, followed by a Disney- and Pixar-branded streaming service in the second half of 2019. Disney CEO Bob Iger called it ""an entirely new growth strategy for the company, one that takes advantage of the incredible opportunity that changing technology provides us to leverage the strength of our great brands.""

That was all well and good at the time, as Disney was prepared to gradually grow its services through its controlling stake in direct-to-consumer streaming tech company BAMTech. But these newly acquired assets from Fox should provide Disney the more immediate scale it needs to effectively challenge streaming media stalwarts like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video -- both from a content perspective and through the supplemental technical capabilities of Hulu.

It stands to reason, then, that adding multiple prominent new streaming services from Disney should only accelerate the shift of advertising dollars and viewership to platforms like the ones Roku provides. Roku will not only benefit from advertising and marketing spending on those services, but should also receive a slice of subscriber revenue if viewers use its platform to sign up.

The bottom line

That's not to say Roku is a guaranteed winner for investors today. After Roku's post-IPO pop in September and its most recent earnings report last month, the company's stock has already nearly quadrupled from its $14-per-share IPO price. But given Roku's status as a key beneficiary of the industry shift to streaming media, and in light of the positive consequences of the Disney-Fox deal, it's also hard to blame the market for its enthusiasm.

At the very least, I think opportunistic investors would do well to add Roku to their watch lists.","The deal that changes everythingMore specifically, two weeks ago, Disney announced it had agreed to acquire most of Fox's assets in a mammoth all-stock deal worth roughly $52.4 billion.

18,"Oct 12, 2017",Nasdaq,Your Complete Guide to Everything Owned by Comcast,"Comcast Corp. CMCSA is the one of the world's biggest media companies, ranking among peers like The Walt Disney Company DIS , 21 st Century Fox FOXA , Viacom VIA , and now, tech giants like Facebook FB and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL .

It is still the United States' largest broadband provider, with over 22 million high-speed Internet customers. Comcast has an impressive market value of almost $180 billion. Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Philadelphia, Comcast has created a media empire over the years due to smart acquisitions and media asset-building. Let's take a look at what the media and entertainment conglomerate owns and operates.

Entertainment

Comcast has a big foothold in the entertainment industry, with many of its assets falling in film and television.

Film

Comcast owns popular film studio Universal Studios. It is considered one of Hollywood's ""Big 6"" film studios, along with Warner Bros. Entertainment, The Walt Disney Studios, Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, Fox Filmed Entertainment, and Paramount Motion Pictures Group.

The studio has produced classic films like To Kill A Mockingbird , Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds , and Schindler's List , as well as the recent blockbuster s Get Out and The Fate of the Furious . Its highest-grossing movie to-date is 2015's Jurassic World .

Universal operates smaller film studio divisions including Illumination Entertainment, art house-centered Focus Features, Working Title Films, Universal Animation Studios, Universal Interactive, Universal Pictures International, and Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

Comcast's NBCUniversal division acquired DreamWorks Animation studio for roughly $3.8 billion last year. While DreamWorks is best known for its hit animated franchises Shrek and Kung Fu Panda , much of the studio's value to Comcast is in the so-called ""long tail"" of amusement park integrations, merchandise, and other synergistic deals.

Television

Its most prominent media company is NBCUniversal, which owns and operates a slew of television network companies.

In its portfolio, NBCUniversal has the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network, which includes NBC Entertainment, NBC News, NBC Sports, and NBC Studios. It also owns the NBCUniversal Television Group (Universal Television, NBCUniversal Television Distribution, and NBC-owned local television stations around the country), as well as NBCUniversal Cable (includes popular channels like Bravo, E!, USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, mun2, Chiller, SyFy, Sleuth, and Universal HD).

The company also owns The Weather Channel Companies with private equity firm Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group (BX). This includes the popular Weather Channel, and its interactive components www.weather.com , and mobile and desktop versions.

Through NBCUniversal, Comcast dabbles heavily in sports under NBC Sports Group. This consists of the Universal Sports Network, NBCSN, and the Golf Channel stations, in addition to Comcast SportsNet.

Other sports-themed ventures include the MLB Network in partnership with Major League Baseball and other providers; SportsNet New York in partnership with the New York Mets and Time Warner TWX ; Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast in partnership with Charter Communications CHTR ; and the NHL Network in partnership with the National Hockey League.

The company also has a large international presence with Universal Networks International.

The division is comprised of the LAPTV (Latin America Pay Television Service), a television company that Comcast co-owns with Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures, MGM Studios, and News Corp NWSA -owned 20 th Century Fox.

Universal Networks International also owns the Brazil-based Telecine, which is co-owned with Globosat Canais, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, MGM, and 20 th Century Fox, as well as Universal Channel Latin America, Universal Channel Brazil, SyFy Latin America, and Telemundo, which includes many local Hispanic television networks.

Cable

Comcast did not become the country's biggest cable provider without acquiring valuable companies along the way.

In 1985, Comcast, along with American Television and Communications (a Time, Inc. TIME subsidiary), Tele-Communications, Daniels & Associates, and the Century Southwest Communications Corporation, bought Group W Cable, a division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

In 2001, it bought the largest cable television operator at the time, AT&T Broadband, a division of AT&T T , for over $44 billion.

Then, in 2005, Comcast announced that it had bought Susquehanna Communications, a South Central Pennsylvania-based cable television and broadband services provider and unit of the former Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff company, for $775 million in cash. This gave the company about 230,000 basic cable customers, 71,000 digital cable customers, and 86,000 high-speed Internet customers.

In partnership with Time Warner in 2006, Comcast purchased the majority of the floundering Adelphia Communications Corporation, which was the fifth largest cable company in the U.S. before filing for bankruptcy.

Comcast began promoting its Xfinity service in 2010. This includes what they call their ""triple play"" services: digital cable, cable Internet access, and cable telephone. Today, most of Comcast's cable services have changed names to reflect the Xfinity brand. For example, Comcast Digital Cable has been renamed ""Xfinity TV,"" Comcast Digital Voice became ""Xfinity Voice,"" and Comcast High-Speed Internet has been renamed ""Xfinity Internet.""

Other Business Units

In order to cash in on digital trends, Comcast created a division called Comcast Interactive Media; this unit includes XFINITY.com and xfintityTV.com, popular movie ticket service Fandango, entertainment ticketing company New Era Tickets, online video publishing company thePlatform, and StreamSage.

The company also owns and operates sports and entertainment venues under the division Comcast Spectacor. Through this unit, Comcast owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL; it also owns and manages the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.

As part of its NBCUniversal division, Comcast owns and operates its theme park subsidiary Universal Parks and Resorts. There are currently four running parks: Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles; Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida; Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, and Universal Studios Singapore in Singapore.

Comcast partnered with Disney and 21 st Century Fox to form Hulu, a video-streaming entity that is a burgeoning competitor to Netflix NFLX and Amazon's AMZN Prime. At this year's Emmys ceremony, Hulu became the first streaming platform to take home the coveted award for Outstanding Drama Series for its critically-acclaimed show The Handmaid's Tale , in addition to winning in seven other categories.

20,"Dec 7, 2017",TheStreet,Fox Value Keeps Rising as Comcast Said to Join Disney in Bidding for Assets,"Interest from the two giants has analysts studying the value of Fox's parts, and bumping up their targets.

With Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) - Get Comcast Corporation Class A Report and Walt Disney Co. (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report reportedly circling, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report valuation keep rising higher -- even after the stock has already climbed for about a month on deal speculation.

Sum-of-the-parts valuations for Fox based on reported details put the entertainment company's worth at around $40 per share, a 18% premium to Fox's $33.77 closing price on Thursday. Vital questions include how much debt the buyer would assume, and whether regulatory risk could influence the bidding prices.

Beyond its film portfolio and its entertainment networks in the U.S., Fox has global distribution networks that would make Disney or Comcast a global power. Fox owns 39% of European satellite TV network Sky LLC and Star India Private Ltd. in India.

""Disney, which has one of the few global media brands largely because of Mickey Mouse and its theme parks, could probably make the most of that additional distribution,"" Moody's Investors Service analyst Neil Begley said. ""When you start thinking about Star Wars and Marvel on top of that, they could benefit [more] than Comcast could.""

For its part, Comcast has invested heavily to improve its set-top box and user interface for its pay-TV service. Begley noted that the company could reap savings by acquiring Sky and Star.

According to CNBC, Disney offered to pay $60 billion or so for Fox's film studios, the Fox entertainment networks, Nat Geo, regional sports networks, Star satellite TV network, Sky and Hulu.

B. Riley FBR analyst Barton Crocket valued the businesses at $61.5 billion in a Thursday note. The analyst suggested that Disney would pay nearly $48.8 billion in equity and $12.8 billion in assumed debt, in a Thursday report, and raised his price target on Fox $2 per share to $38.43.

Among Fox's rich portfolio of assets, Crocket values the sports networks at $17.4 billion, the film studios at $13.6 billion and the Star network in India at $11.5 billion. ""Disney is under-exposed internationally, and India, as the world's second-most populous country, is an egregious area of under-exposure,"" the analyst wrote. Fox's stake in Sky is worth about $8.8 billion, and Crocket values Fox's 30% stake in Hulu LLC at $1.9 billion.

With multiple suitors for Fox's entertainment and other assets, Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst Marci Ryvicker values Fox at $44 per share before taxes -- or $40 after taxes. She attributes $32 per share to assets Disney would buy and $12 per share to the leftover Fox News, Fox Sports, broadcasting and other businesses.

In Ryvicker's model, Disney would take on $11.5 billion of Fox's debt , leaving more than $8 billion on the books of the post-breakup Fox. Including the debt, she values the new Fox at $26 billion.

Fox shareholders would own 31% of Disney, she estimated, with the Murdochs holding a 5% stake.

Disney has a regulatory advantage over Comcast, however. The Department of Justice sued to block AT&T Inc.'s (T) purchase of Time Warner Inc. (TWX), arguing that AT&T's content distribution network could allow it to charge more for Time Warner's movies and TV programs. Comcast, with its vast cable systems, would presumably face similar charges if it tried to acquire Fox's entertainment assets.

As a result, Comcast might have to bid more than Disney to account for the risk, John Janedis of Jefferies suggested in a report. The analyst values the assets for sale at $66 billion, including $12 billion in debt, and suggested Disney is more likely to prevail because of the regulatory concerns. Janedis has a $41 sum-of-the-parts valuation for Fox.

23,"Dec 15, 2017",Exchange4media,Disney to buy 21 Century Fox for $52 billion in stock,"The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (“21st Century Fox” —NASDAQ: FOXA, FOX) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Disney to acquire 21st Century Fox, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios, along with cable and international TV businesses, for approximately $52.4 billion in stock (subject to adjustment). Building on Disney’s commitment to deliver the highest quality branded entertainment, the acquisition of these complementary assets would allow Disney to create more appealing content, build more direct relationships with consumers around the world and deliver a more compelling entertainment experience to consumers wherever and however they choose. Immediately prior to the acquisition, 21st Century Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed company that will be spun off to its shareholders.

Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of 21st Century Fox will receive 0.2745 Disney shares for each 21st Century Fox share they hold (subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities as described below). The exchange ratio was set based on a 30-day volume weighted average price of Disney stock. Disney will also assume approximately $13.7 billion of net debt of 21st Century Fox. The acquisition price implies a total equity value of approximately $52.4 billion and a total transaction value of approximately $66.1 billion (in each case based on the stated exchange ratio assuming no adjustment) for the business to be acquired by Disney, which includes consolidated assets along with a number of equity investments.

Popular Entertainment Properties to Join Disney Family

Combining with Disney are 21st Century Fox’s critically acclaimed film production businesses, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures and Fox 2000, which together offer diverse and compelling storytelling businesses and are the homes of Avatar, X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool, as well as The Grand Budapest Hotel, Hidden Figures, Gone Girl, The Shape of Water and The Martian—and its storied television creative units, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox21, which have brought The Americans, This Is Us, Modern Family, The Simpsons and so many more hit TV series to viewers across the globe. Disney will also acquire FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Fox Sports Regional Networks, Fox Networks Group International, Star India and Fox’s interests in Hulu, Sky plc, Tata Sky and Endemol Shine Group.

“The acquisition of this stellar collection of businesses from 21st Century Fox reflects the increasing consumer demand for a rich diversity of entertainment experiences that are more compelling, accessible and convenient than ever before,” said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. “We’re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we’re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings. The deal will also substantially expand our international reach, allowing us to offer world-class storytelling and innovative distribution platforms to more consumers in key markets around the world.”

“We are extremely proud of all that we have built at 21st Century Fox, and I firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace in what is an exciting and dynamic industry,” said Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox. “Furthermore, I’m convinced that this combination, under Bob Iger’s leadership, will be one of the greatest companies in the world. I’m grateful and encouraged that Bob has agreed to stay on, and is committed to succeeding with a combined team that is second to none.”

At the request of both 21st Century Fox and the Disney Board of Directors, Mr. Iger has agreed to continue as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company through the end of calendar year 2021.

“When considering this strategic acquisition, it was important to the Board that Bob remain as Chairman and CEO through 2021 to provide the vision and proven leadership required to successfully complete and integrate such a massive, complex undertaking,” said Orin C. Smith, Lead Independent Director of the Disney Board. “We share the belief of our counterparts at 21st Century Fox that extending his tenure is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and will be critical to Disney’s ability to effectively drive long-term value from this extraordinary acquisition.”

Benefits to Consumers

The acquisition will enable Disney to accelerate its use of innovative technologies, including its BAMTECH platform, to create more ways for its storytellers to entertain and connect directly with audiences while providing more choices for how they consume content. The complementary offerings of each company enhance Disney’s development of films, television programming and related products to provide consumers with a more enjoyable and immersive entertainment experience.

Bringing on board 21st Century Fox’s entertainment content and capabilities, along with its broad international footprint and a world-class team of managers and storytellers, will allow Disney to further its efforts to provide a more compelling entertainment experience through its direct-to-consumer (DTC) offerings. This transaction will enable Disney’s recently announced Disney and ESPN-branded DTC offerings, as well as Hulu, to create more appealing and engaging experiences, delivering content, entertainment and sports to consumers around the world wherever and however they want to enjoy it.

The agreement also provides Disney with the opportunity to reunite the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool with the Marvel family under one roof and create richer, more complex worlds of inter-related characters and stories that audiences have shown they love. The addition of Avatar to its family of films also promises expanded opportunities for consumers to watch and experience storytelling within these extraordinary fantasy worlds. Already, guests at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World Resort can experience the magic of Pandora—The World of Avatar, a new land inspired by the Fox film franchise that opened earlier this year. And through the incredible storytelling of National Geographic—whose mission is to explore and protect our planet and inspire new generations through education initiatives and resources—Disney will be able to offer more ways than ever before to bring kids and families the world and all that is in it.

Enhancing Disney’s Worldwide Offerings





Adding 21st Century Fox’s premier international properties enhances Disney’s position as a truly global entertainment company with authentic local production and consumer services across high-growth regions, including a richer array of local, national and global sporting events that ESPN can make available to fans around the world. The transaction boosts Disney’s international revenue mix and exposure.

Disney’s international reach would greatly expand through the addition of Sky, which serves nearly 23 million households in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy; Fox Networks International, with more than 350 channels in 170 countries; and Star India, which operates 69 channels reaching 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other countries.

Prior to the close of the transaction, it is anticipated that 21st Century Fox will seek to complete its planned acquisition of the 61% of Sky it doesn’t already own. Sky is one of Europe’s most successful pay television and creative enterprises with innovative and high-quality direct-to-consumer platforms, resonant brands and a strong and respected leadership team. 21st Century Fox remains fully committed to completing the current Sky offer and anticipates that, subject to the necessary regulatory consents, the transaction will close by June 30, 2018. Assuming 21st Century Fox completes its acquisition of Sky prior to closing of the transaction, The Walt Disney Company would assume full ownership of Sky, including the assumption of its outstanding debt, upon closing.

Transaction Highlights



The acquisition is expected to yield at least $2 billion in cost savings from efficiencies realized through the combination of businesses, and to be accretive to earnings before the impact of purchase accounting for the second fiscal year after the close of the transaction.

Terms of the transaction call for Disney to issue approximately 515 million new shares to 21st Century Fox shareholders, representing approximately a 25% stake in Disney on a pro forma basis. The per share consideration is subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities arising from the spinoff and other transactions related to the acquisition. The initial exchange ratio of 0.2745 Disney shares for each 21st Century Fox share was set based on an estimate of such tax liabilities to be covered by an $8.5 billion cash dividend to 21st Century Fox from the company to be spun off. The exchange ratio will be adjusted immediately prior to closing of the acquisition based on an updated estimate of such tax liabilities. Such adjustment could increase or decrease the exchange ratio, depending upon whether the final estimate is lower or higher, respectively, than the initial estimate. However, if the final estimate of the tax liabilities is lower than the initial estimate, the first $2 billion of that adjustment will instead be made by net reduction in the amount of the cash dividend to 21st Century Fox from the company to be spun off. The amount of such tax liabilities will depend upon several factors, including tax rates in effect at the time of closing as well as the value of the company to be spun off.

The Boards of Directors of Disney and 21st Century Fox have approved the transaction, which is subject to shareholder approval by 21st Century Fox and Disney shareholders, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, a number of other non-United States merger and other regulatory reviews, and other customary closing conditions.

25,"Dec 29, 2017",Nasdaq,15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can't help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.

While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.

The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC , and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.

Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.

The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.

1. Amazon Buys Whole Foods

Earlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.

2. Intel Acquires Mobileye

Intel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.

3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell Collins

In a major industry deal, United Technologies UTX agreed to buy Rockwell Collins COL for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.

4. Disney To Buy Some of 21 st Century Fox's Assets

Just a few weeks ago, Disney DIS and 21 st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse's parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate's assets, including the film studio 20 th Century Fox, the company's TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA's stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.

5. JAB Holdings Acquires Panera

For $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet's Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.

6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo

""Affordable"" luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo's footprint. This likely won't be Kors' last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, ""luxury group.""

7. Coach Buys Kate Spade

Coach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR , shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers-it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez-and to rebrand itself as a broader ""lifestyle assortment company.""

8. CVS Buys Aetna

After weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna AET for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS's 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

9. Gilead Acquires Kite Pharma

In October, Gilead Sciences GILD shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.

10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoft

In a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco CSCO paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft BSFT , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub ""the future of work,"" as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.

11. Apple Buys Shazam

Recently, iPhone maker Apple AAPL confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app's augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.

12. Arby's Roark Buys Buffalo Wild Wings

Just last month, Arby's owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby's has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby's will also assume the debt of BWLD.

13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.

The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines-based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens , Family Circle , and Shape , among others, while Time owns T ime , People , Sports Illustrated , Fortune , Entertainment Weekly , and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.

14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks Interactive

In November, Discovery's DISCA $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive SNI received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp's portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.

15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone Team

This fall, Alphabet's GOOGL Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC's mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC's team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.

More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

26,"Jan 31, 2018",The Motley Fool,3 Big-Brand Stocks to Buy Now,"What's in a name?

For many companies, a name can be everything. Some brand names are so beloved that consumers will gravitate toward a brand's products practically without thinking of the alternatives. That's a serious competitive advantage for a company, and one that can be worth billions of dollars.

Investors looking to capitalize on the competitive advantages afforded by a big brand would do well to look into these three stocks.

The most magical place on Earth

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is a media conglomerate that houses several popular brands. There's its flagship brand, Disney, which includes its film studio, cable television channel, theme parks, and consumer goods. It also owns ESPN -- ""The Worldwide Leader in Sports"" -- which is the driving force behind its media networks. Oh, and it owns Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, ABC, and 30% of Hulu -- all big brands in and of themselves.

Disney's brands give the company exceptional pricing power. ESPN, for example, charges the highest carriage fees of any cable network by far. If you and the family want to spend a couple days at Disney World, you can easily spend around $1,000.

Disney is able to monetize its popular characters through box-office sales, its theme parks, and consumer goods. It makes new experiences at its theme parks, new films based on old characters, and a continual stream of new toys. It also licenses its brands and intellectual property like Marvel to other content creators.

Disney is about to make the next step in leveraging its strong brands. It's going to offer direct-to-consumer streaming video services for both its ESPN brand and its Disney brand. Disney's strong brand and content library should make the Disney platform a success, and the ESPN platform should shore up the declining subscriber base of its cable networks.

Finally, Disney's brand could get even stronger with the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA) film and television properties. Fox is a strong brand itself, and the acquisition should add considerable pricing power in Disney's media networks segment while bringing even more new characters to its theme parks.

Continued box office dominance, a parks business that keeps raking in visitors, and a strong presence in every cable package make Disney stock a buy.

The coffeehouse on every corner

Starbucks' (NASDAQ:SBUX) brand is not only one of the most recognized in coffee, but in all of the restaurant industry. Besides Starbucks Coffee, Starbucks also owns Tazo Tea and Teavana. Starbucks is in the process of closing its Teavana stores, but the brand will continue to live on in Starbucks stores and in grocery aisles.

Starbucks' started fiscal 2018 with worse-than-expected earnings. Its same-store sales grew just 2% last quarter, while management was guiding for growth of 3% to 5% for the year. And guidance for ""soft"" comparable sales in the second quarter means that it'll be lucky to reach the bottom end of that range.

As a result of the weak earnings, Starbucks shares pulled back. That may present a buying opportunity for investors interested in the strong brand.

The poor results are not a reflection of any problems with Starbucks' brand. Management attributed the problem with its holiday offers not resonating (as they haven't changed much in several years), a decrease in mall traffic as more people do their holiday shopping online, and pressure on non-Starbucks Rewards members. Management is taking steps to resolve the issues it has control over, including onboarding new Rewards members through a co-branded credit card later this year and opening digital payments to non-Rewards members.

But the big brand story remains in China, where the company is expanding rapidly and taking full advantage of its brand strength. Sales in China increased 30% last quarter, and its comparable-store sales were up 6%, driven entirely by an increase in transactions. The company opened 300 new stores in the region, bringing its total to 7,800. What's more, management expects the acquisition of East China, which brought 3,100 Starbucks stores under corporate's control, will accelerate growth in the region going forward.

With the tremendous growth potential in China and slight improvements coming in U.S. operations, Starbucks shares could be a great opportunity for investors right now.

Shaving its brand portfolio

Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has shed the majority of its brands in recent years, dropping from 170 in 2014 to 65 today. Still, it's the owner of familiar household names like Gillette, Pampers, Head & Shoulders, and Tide.

While capital appreciation has been practically nonexistent as it shed those brands, the company is now poised to benefit from greater focus on its higher-return brands. Management reported 3% sales growth during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, indicating the efforts to drive greater sales from a smaller brand portfolio are starting to pay off. The company can now focus its marketing efforts on a few select products.

That said, Procter & Gamble is still facing an ultra-competitive environment. Its brand strength should support modest sales increases, and the introduction of higher-margin premium products from its most popular brands like Tide should help improve gross margin.

P&G should be able to drive profitable growth through continued cost-cutting efforts. Management expects to extract another $10 billion in efficiencies through reduced overhead, lower cost of goods sold, and marketing efficiencies. The strength of its brands is key to those last two points, as they allow the company to benefit from increased scale. The addition of activist investor Nelson Peltz to the board of directors should ensure management stays on course in its efforts to improve profitability, but I don't think it necessarily means we'll see a significant change in the company's current strategy.

P&G is a much more conservative investment, representing a noncyclical consumer goods company. The fact that it's lagged the market in recent years as other companies have boomed is no surprise, but when the next economic downturn hits, P&G is poised to outperform, held up by the strength of its brands. In the meantime, the stock pays out a very nice dividend, yielding about 3.1% with annual raises from management.

Big brands worth buying

It's worth noting that none of these three big-brand companies are without faults: Disney's media networks are losing subscribers, Starbucks' stores in the U.S. aren't growing sales as quickly as anticipated, and P&G is losing market share. But those problems are what make them great buys today, because the brand strength of each of these companies should help them overcome those problems.","There's its flagship brand, Disney, which includes its film studio, cable television channel, theme parks, and consumer goods.

27,"Feb 13, 2018",Latest Headlines on CNN Business,Hulu's been a breakout success. It also lost $920 million last year,"Hulu's got critically acclaimed content, a growing number of subscribers and determination to take on its bigger rivals.

But it's losing a ton of money in the process -- $920 million in 2017, according to an analysis published last week by the financial services firm BTIG.

That's nearly as much as the $1 billion that the service's four owners -- Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX) -- invested in it last year, wrote BTIG media analyst Rich Greenfield. (CNN is owned by Time Warner.)

Greenfield said his firm expects Hulu will lose nearly $1.7 billion this year.

Hulu declined to comment about the analysis.

It's not surprising that the company would lose money.

Netflix (NFLX) plans to spend as much as $8 billion on original content this year. But Netflix has about 118 million subscribers, along with worldwide reach. Netflix can spend that much money and turn a profit (it earned more than half a billion dollars last year).

Hulu doesn't have the luxury of a large audience -- just 17 million subscribers. That's growing, but Netflix is still seven times bigger.

""The problem with Hulu's losses are, they are not global, and the number of subscribers is not that large,"" Greenfield told CNNMoney this week. ""It points to just how difficult it is to replicate what Netflix has built.""

Related: 'Handmaid's Tale' effect? Hulu grows to 17 million subscribers

The competition to attract cord-cutting TV viewers is fierce. Amazon, HBO and Apple TV are also all plunking down big money on shows.

Hulu hasn't been shy about spending, either. In addition to airing originals like ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" it also has snagged the rights to popular throwbacks like ""Seinfeld, ""Golden Girls"" and ""Full House.""

And less than a year ago, it launched a new live TV streaming service with content from ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and a slew of cable channels.

Hulu has touted its investments and the results in recent weeks. The company announced in January that it generated $1 billion in ad revenue in 2017.

Daniel Ives, an analyst with GHB Insights, described the multi-billion-dollar battle between the streaming services as an ""arms race."" And he said the competition is what makes Hulu's relative success remarkable, despite its losses.

""What Hulu's accomplished, with much less resources, has been admirable and impressive,"" Ives said. ""And it speaks to why it's one of the crown jewels that Disney was attracted to.""

Disney's interest in Hulu will likely be a big factor in determining the service's future. The company announced late last year that it would try to buy most of 21st Century Fox, another partial owner of Hulu, for $52 billion.

Related: Disney is buying most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion

It's not yet clear how Hulu could change, and Ives said Disney would likely want to keep its intentions quiet when the deal works its way through antitrust regulators.

But if the deal is successful, Disney's 30% stake in Hulu would become a 60% majority. And the company would add big-name Fox franchises like the X-Men and Avatar to a lineup that already includes the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars -- all fodder to consider for distribution on Hulu.

""The best thing that ever happened to Hulu was Disney buying Fox,"" Ives said. Disney already has plans to launch its own streaming service next year, but Ives suggests that Hulu could be complementary.

""It's going to be a two headed monster that they are going to compete against Netflix,"" Ives said. While he expected Disney to treat its standalone service as its big moneymaker, he said Hulu would still be ""the little brother.""

Greenfield cautioned, though, that the deal isn't done yet. Hulu's future would also depend on what Comcast, another 30% owner, has planned. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Comcast, which has tried to buy Fox in the past, is considering a new bid.

""It actually isn't clear whether the Fox acquisition makes running Hulu dramatically easier,"" Greenfield said. Unless Disney can fully own the service, it would still have to contend with another meaningful partner.

""Hulu's future is totally up in limbo,"" he added. ""The reality is, Hulu does a great job of generating revenue for its parent companies ... What Hulu's longterm role in the subscription video-on-demand space is, is unclear.""","Hulu's got critically acclaimed content, a growing number of subscribers and determination to take on its bigger rivals.

30,"Mar 19, 2018",The Motley Fool,Disney Reorganizes to Better Compete in a New World,"The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has struggled over the past few years from the advent of streaming video, cord-cutting, and subscriber losses at its flagship ESPN sports network. Disney has, however, taken a number of steps to counter these emerging threats.

The company is planning the launch of two new streaming services. The first will be a companion service for ESPN subscribers that will be introduced this spring. The second, due to make its debut late in 2019, will serve as the streaming home for content from the company's Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel, and Disney film studios.

The pending acquisition of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) was of strategic importance as well, providing Disney with a windfall of additional content, as well as a controlling stake in streaming service Hulu.

Now Disney is taking the next step.

Shuffling the deck

Disney reported this week that it was conducting a strategic reorganization of its business that would take effect immediately and better position the company for future success.

Previous Business Segment New Business Segment Media Networks Media Networks Parks and Resorts Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products Studio Entertainment Studio Entertainment Consumer Products and Interactive Media Direct-to-Consumer and International

The reshuffling will combine the parks and resorts and the consumer products segments, while adding a new direct-to-consumer and international segment. Several smaller businesses will also move between segments.

New organization, same great content

In a press release, Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger said the company is positioning itself for the future by ""creating a more effective, global framework."" He went on to say, ""With our unparalleled Studio and Media Networks serving as content engines for the Company, we are combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology, and international operations to deliver the entertainment and sports content consumers around the world want most, with more choice, personalization, and convenience than ever before.""

Disney's chief strategy officer, Kevin Mayer, will head up the direct-to-consumer and international business segment. Mayer, though not a household name, oversaw the Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm acquisitions -- as well as the pending deal with Twenty-First Century Fox.

The newly created segment will serve as the ""global, multiplatform media, technology, and distribution organization"" for Disney's content. Having a single unit charged with controlling the worldwide distribution of programming will allow the company to better compete in an environment increasingly dominated by streaming.

Bob Chapek, who has successfully helmed both Disney's parks and resorts unit and the consumer products business, will now head the expanded parks, experiences, and consumer products segment.

Addressing a changing paradigm

This move seems designed to carve out a space for the company's upcoming streaming services, but there may be even more going on just below the surface. The restructuring comes in advance of the Fox acquisition, and anticipates the combination by placing responsibility for distribution of all the company's content assets under one roof.

In addition, both Mayer and Chapek have each headed multiple business segments at the entertainment empire, potentially setting them up to compete for Iger's job. Disney's chairman and CEO has extended his tenure and postponed his planned retirement three times, with a fourth extension conditional on Disney's successful acquisition of Fox.

This new organizational structure appears to anticipate the world of Disney as it will be in the near future and, in Iger's words, ""to serve consumers worldwide, increase growth, and maximize shareholder value.""","The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has struggled over the past few years from the advent of streaming video, cord-cutting, and subscriber losses at its flagship ESPN sports network.

31,"Dec 16, 2017",The Motley Fool,3 Times Netflix CEO Reed Hastings Predicted the Future,"Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a big winner since its inception 20 years ago, both as as an entertainment provider and then as a stock, but that success hasn't been an accident. A major reason the company has been so successful -- now worth more than $80 billion and larger than rivals like Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and the recently acquired Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) -- is the leadership of CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings.

As an enterprise combining Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Fox, and tech giants like Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet, are all preparing for an assault on Netflix and video streaming, it's worth remembering that Netflix has as important a competitive advantage as any other. After all, Hastings has transformed the company from a DVD-by-mail enterprise, to one streaming movies over the internet, to a Hollywood powerhouse that is putting out dozens of original TV shows and movies each year (spending more than any of its competitors on content).

Hastings' ability to see where the industry is going and prepare for it has given his company a consistent lead over the competition. Let's take a look at three times in the past when he has successfully predicted the future.

1. Envisioning video streaming

When Hastings launched Netflix in 1997, video stores ruled. Blockbuster was the king of video entertainment and would continue to be so for the next decade, even as Netflix presented a growing challenge. Shipping DVDs through the mail was a novel idea, but Hastings always saw that as a transitory model to watching video directly over the internet -- what we now call streaming. That's why he called the company Netflix, as opposed to, say, ""Movies by Mail.""

In its S-1 filing to go public in 2002, Netflix essentially mapped out its streaming strategy, saying, ""We continue to monitor additional delivery technologies and, when appropriate, believe that we are well-positioned to offer digital distribution to our subscribers."" This was three years before YouTube was founded, and internet video was still in a primitive stage. Yet Netflix was priming itself for the eventual development of streaming technology, cultivating relationships with customers and production studios, developing its recommendation engine, and building brand value. Not surprisingly, Netflix became the leader in streaming, as it had been in DVDs-by-mail.

2. Calling out HBO

In 2011, Hastings called HBO GO, the new on-demand service from HBO, Netflix's primary competition; this was a notable retort to a statement just a year earlier by Jeff Bewkes, CEO of HBO's parent Time Warner, comparing Netflix to the Albanian army. Calling out HBO was a savvy move; it helped redirect Netflix, then making the first season of House of Cards, towards becoming a service generating the kind of critically acclaimed content that HBO is known for. And Netflix has done that over time, as the company nearly matched HBO in Emmy nominations at this year's awards.

In 2013, Hastings doubled down by saying, ""The goal is to become HBO faster than they can become us."" While it was dismissed by critics at the time, as HBO was the clear king of premium television, that prediction has played out: HBO launched its own streaming service, HBO NOW, while Netflix's brand is becoming increasingly associated with original entertainment.

3. Foreseeing the streaming takeover

Also in 2011, when streaming was just in its infancy and Netflix lost nearly 1 million customers splitting its streaming and DVD-by-mail services, Hastings predicted that half of TV viewing in the country would come through internet streaming by 2021.

Judging by a recent Pew Research Center survey, Hastings' forecast looks prescient. Twenty-eight percent of all U.S. adults said they primarily use an online streaming service to watch TV, but about half of American adults ages 18 to 49 favored streaming. As Netflix and its peers become more popular, streaming services could reach 50% of the total TV market by 2021.

Hastings made a similar prediction more recently, saying at a conference in 2015 that internet TV would grow every year for the next 20, while linear TV would decline each year over that time. While it's too soon to say if that prediction will come true, it seems apt: Pay-TV subscribers are steadily but slowly declining, while Netflix and other streaming services continue to add new members.

With the streaming battle entering its next phase as Disney acquires Fox, pending regulatory approval, it's important to realize how much of an advantage these forecasts have given Netflix. Six years after Netflix started offering a stand-alone streaming service, Disney is finally preparing to do the same, since it's ridden a crumbling cable model for as long as it can.

Netflix has over 100 million subscribers worldwide and an ever-growing library of original content. In fact, Hastings now sees the streaming entertainment pie growing so big that he no longer regards HBO as his company's biggest competitor. Now, he believes it's...sleep.","Let's take a look at three times in the past when he has successfully predicted the future.

32,"Jan 22, 2018",The Motley Fool,3 Stocks for Warren Buffett Fans,"As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), one of the world's richest people, and arguably the greatest investor of all time, Warren Buffett has no shortage of fans. And it's no surprise that millions listen closely to what Buffett has to say, particularly as it pertains to what he looks for in an investment.

To that end, we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a stock that they believe Warren Buffett fans can appreciate. Read on to learn why they chose Disney (NYSE:DIS), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI).

The world's undisputed entertainment leader

Steve Symington (Disney): If Disney wasn't already the world's most successful entertainment conglomerate, it will be when it closes on its pending acquisition of most of Twenty-First Century Fox's assets around the middle of 2018.

Assuming the mammoth $52.4 billion all-stock deal passes regulatory muster -- a fair concern among investors given its sheer size -- Disney will take ownership of cinematic properties such as Avatar, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Deadpool. The company will also acquire TV titles like This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, as well as channels including FX Networks, National Geographic, and Fox Sports Regional Networks. Disney will also own Star in India, a 39% stake in European satellite TV provider Sky, and a controlling stake in Hulu. Of course, that's in addition to its namesake TV channels and movie studios and its existing ownership of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, ABC, 50% of A&E Networks, and 80% of ESPN.

If that wasn't enough, keep in mind Disney aims to return at least 20% of the cash it generates to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.

In the end, the combination should create an enviable business with a moat that you can be sure Warren Buffett -- and his fans -- would love.

A top dividend in biopharma

George Budwell (Sanofi): The French drugmaker Sanofi has now been part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for over eleven years. In fact, Sanofi is only one of three healthcare stocks that has even made its way into Berkshire's long-term holdings.

Healthcare stocks, after all, tend to have narrow economic moats due to their reliance on patents with a limited shelf life to ward off competitors. Buffett, by contrast, is well-known to favor companies with wide economic moats that can generate sustainable profits over exceptionally long periods of time.

So why does Sanofi get a pass from the Oracle from Omaha? The most likely reason is simple enough: Sanofi has consistently paid one of the richest dividends in the entire healthcare sector -- underscored by the fact that the company is presently heading into its 24th consecutive year of dividend growth.

In many ways, Sanofi's top notch dividend, which sports an attractive yield of 3.68% at current levels, has been its saving grace. Because of the loss of exclusivity for its megablockbuster diabetes drug Lantus, Sanofi's stock has lagged well behind the high-flying biopharma industry for most of the past decade. Even so, the company's juicy dividend has kept investors in the black during this exceedingly difficult period of product turnover.

What's next? Sanofi is currently searching for its next set of star drugs to drive growth. As part of this process, the drugmaker recently bought Biogen's hemophilia spin-off Bioverativ, and it's reportedly on the hunt for even more bolt-on acquisitions in the wake of this sizable $11.6 billion deal. Although biopharma acquisitions do tend to come at a sky-high premium that eats up lots of cash, Sanofi undoubtedly needs to restock the cupboard in order to push past Lantus' patent expiration -- implying that this acquisition frenzy is a necessary evil.

The good news is that Sanofi does have the financial flexibility to support both its M&A activity and its top-tier dividend program moving forward. As such, income investors shouldn't worry too much about a possible reduction to the company's rich dividend program anytime soon.

A left-behind infrastructure giant

John Bromels (Kinder Morgan): Buffett has already shown willingness to buy into companies with lots of physical assets -- think Berkshire's purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe or its 16% stake in Phillips 66. That's why I think a stake in gas pipeline operator Kinder Morgan might be right up his alley.

Kinder Morgan is the world's largest pipeline owner, and its ""toll booth"" model for charging for gas traveling through its pipelines means that, like Phillips 66, it's somewhat insulated from fluctuations in gas prices. But neither that industry-leading position nor that business model helped the company's stock in recent years. The market hammered Kinder Morgan shares in 2015 after it announced a quarterly dividend cut from $0.51/share to $0.125/share, where it still sits today. Then, in 2017, the company's share price managed to lag its peers even as it delivered on its strategic plans. That's gotten the company's share price down to levels that might even make Buffett himself take note.

Things may finally be looking up for Kinder Morgan: The company is planning to up its dividend 60% in 2018, with further increases in future years. It's continuing to develop new infrastructure to maintain its industry-leading position. Also, with North American gas production at record levels, the company should have plenty of market for its services well into the future. All that makes Kinder Morgan a great pick for Buffett fans.

The bottom line

Of course, there's no way to guarantee that these three businesses will deliver the market-beating returns that made Warren Buffett a household name. But when we consider the addition of Fox's assets to Disney's already huge base, the fact that Sanofi is one of few healthcare stocks that Buffett actually owns, and Kinder Morgan's industry leadership -- as well as generous capital returns policies from all three companies -- we like their chances of doing just that.","As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), one of the world's richest people, and arguably the greatest investor of all time, Warren Buffett has no shortage of fans.

33,"Oct 25, 2017",MarketWatch,Hollywood has never seen competition like Netflix,"Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.46% is planning to release 80 films in 2018, which by Hollywood standards is ambitious and aggressive.

Chief content officer Ted Sarandos said on the company’s quarterly earnings interview on Monday that the streaming giant released eight films in the 2017 third quarter and has close to 80 set to hit the service next year.

Last year, the six major Hollywood studios -- Disney DIS, +4.04% , Warner Bros. US:TWX, 20th Century Fox FOXA, +1.67% , Universal Pictures CMCSA, +2.29% , Sony US:SNE and Paramount Pictures US:VIAB — released a combined 106 films. That figure does not include films released under their subsidiary labels, but it puts into perspective the enormous challenge Netflix is facing.

Also read:Netflix plans huge movie push as it faces post-Disney reality

Check out:Everything new on Netflix in October, and what’s leaving

“I wish them luck,” Fox domestic distribution head Chris Aronson said in an email. “An 80-film slate in one year does not seem practical or sustainable in any way. It likely will increase competition for projects, but their development has to be quite short which will likely impact quality.”

ComScore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian asked how the company will juggle multiple productions that would have to be going on simultaneously, given the scale of the plan.

Why Competing With Netflix and Amazon Is Impossible

There’s no telling exactly how many of Netflix’s 80 films will be original productions rather than films they snatch up at festivals like Sundance and elsewhere.

Sarandos saidthe 80-film slate would include a range of films from $1 million Sundance flicks to big-budget blockbusters like Netflix’s $90 million-film “Bright,” starring Will Smith.

“Bright,” directed by “Suicide Squad” director David Ayer, is one of Netflix’s most expensive projects to date, and is certainly the company’s most ambitious film. From the trailer it looks like a movie that could be released in theaters during the summer.

“It’s a big number,” Chris Spicer, an entertainment finance lawyer at law firm Akin Gump, said of Netflix’s 80-film release slate. “I’m even more blown away by the numbers, I mean, $90 million for a film that’s not going to be released in theaters seems crazy.”

Don’t miss:Netflix wants exclusive rights to films, TV shows and the talent creating them

Netflix is looking more like a Hollywood studio, but the metrics compared to other studios are different, Spicer said.

The 106 films from the major studios last year all had to compete for a limited number of screens in a limited number of theaters, and that’s where films try to recoup a big chunk of the budget. So in addition to spending hundreds of millions producing films, the studios shelled out millions more on marketing and promotion.

Netflix has the benefit of unlimited space, but it misses out on the revenue generated from phenomena like “Split” or “Get Out” when they’re a surprise box office hit. There’s also no ancillary market like DVD sales for Netflix, though studios are no longer garnering the same returns from that market as they used to.

Netflix still relies mainly on subscription revenue. Licensing content and selling merchandise hasn’t been a material contributor. Netflix increased the cost of subscriptions recently, but the company’s debt continues to rise. Sarandos said content spend will increase to $7 billion to $8 billion next year, up from $6 billion in 2017.

The company already has $17 billion in content commitments spread over the next several years, and Netflix expects free cash flow to remain negative for several years.

Producing high-quality films is not cheap. Sarandos said Martin Scorsese’s highly-publicized Netflix debut “The Irishman” is in production now. That film, which Sarandos said is expected to be shown in 2019, reportedly cost north of $100 million.

“It’s incredibly impressive, but it’s all about the money, and they seem to have the resources to make it happen,” Dergarabedian said. “I don’t think this is something that anyone could have prepared for even two years ago, but competition is a good thing. It’s pretty amazing, the evolution of Netflix.”","Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.46% is planning to release 80 films in 2018, which by Hollywood standards is ambitious and aggressive.

34,"Mar 12, 2018",The Motley Fool,3 Stocks You Can Safely Own Until 2030,"What's better than a fantastic investment for today? One that will keep rewarding you over the long run, of course. Compounding returns over many years, or even decades, is the magic wand that turns today's modest investments into tomorrow's millionaires.

So we asked a few of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to share their best ideas for stocks that will keep on giving for many years to come. Here's why our panelists would trust Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to deliver market-beating returns for at least the next 12 years.

Coffee is a safe bet

Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Starbucks): People have been sipping coffee for centuries, and I'd say it's a safe bet that Starbucks will still be a leading player in the industry well into the next decade.

That's not to say that the beverage titan's business will look the same in 2030 as it does today. Most of Starbucks' future growth will likely come from its international segment, after all. Its China segment is especially attractive, given that its latest class of stores is setting customer traffic and profitability records. Executives see that market growing to many times the size of the U.S. over time, and they couldn't be more bullish on their prospects there. ""No western consumer brand is better positioned than Starbucks in China,"" CEO Kevin Johnson recently said to investors.

Sure, the chain is facing major challenges in the U.S. market, where customer traffic has stalled. That slowdown has persisted despite management's best efforts to jump-start afternoon traffic over the last year. Starbucks has made the necessary adjustments to recapture its growth momentum in the past, though, and there's no reason to believe it can't do the same thing here. However, even if sluggishness continues in the U.S., there's little danger of this world-class business losing its prime market position in the years ahead.

You just don't get more brand value

Anders Bylund (Walt Disney): If there's one brand I'm sure will have legs for the next decade or two (or three, or...), that would be Disney. With great brand power comes...great long-term investor returns, so Walt Disney is an easy answer to this question -- downright obvious, even.

It's simple to find a current example of my brand-power adage: Just take a look in Disney's rearview mirror. Over the last 12 years, Disney investors have pocketed a market-beating 266% return:

This surge was powered by Disney's unmatched library of family-friendly characters and stories.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe played a big part, building up the Avengers franchise out of some lesser-known superhero names. Now, every Marvel movie is a near-guaranteed smash hit with billion-dollar potential at the box office.

Lucasfilm's Star Wars saga is an even safer cash machine, since even spinoff titles such as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story can hit that coveted billion-dollar mark globally. And don't forget about eternal hit factory Pixar.

Disney's own burnished brand holds the power to break all animation records, with an unheralded film loosely inspired by H.C. Andersen's The Snow Queen. Disney churns out megahits in its sleep, and I see no signs of the bandwagon slowing down.

The same old story will keep on playing in 2019 and beyond, with some additional twists. And the pending buyout of Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) should offer another adrenaline shot in the Marvel/Lucasfilm/Pixar vein.

Next year Disney is pulling away from a successful partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to launch its own digital streaming platform around the world. Getting back to that top-shelf brand, the mouse ears alone should let Disney hit the ground running in the streaming video market.

And Disney is a master of exploiting and monetizing its brand. From movie tickets to theme park passes, from hotel resorts to themed cruise lines, from Mickey Mouse footwear to Cinderella dolls, there's no corner of the consumer market that Disney can't or won't dominate. This is the largest and most successful licensing vendor in the world, and that's a sustainable business advantage.

In a nutshell, that's why I'm more comfortable recommending Disney for the next decade-and-change than any other stock in today's market and my own portfolio -- including Netflix. The Disney brand provides predictable staying power for the very long haul.

Don't let the name fool you

Tyler Crowe (American Tower): ""American Tower"" is a bit of a misnomer for this real estate investment trust. Despite its name including the word ""American,"" the company's business of owning and leasing space on cellular towers to telecommunications companies is international. Of the 149,000 or so towers in its portfolio, more than 108,000 are outside the U.S. And the company expects that number to grow even more, as it plans to close a deal for another 20,000 towers in India in the first half of this year.

American Tower's focus on the international market is a smart one because of the shifting needs of telecom companies. As more mature cellular networks (like those in the U.S.) deploy 4G and 5G capability, more equipment is required per unit of area. As these mature networks become denser, telecom companies turn to less conventional places for their equipment, using distributed antenna systems -- think equipment on light poles and rooftops.

While American Tower has some distributed antennas in its portfolio, management has elected to invest in less mature telecom markets, where total cellphone use is high but the use of data by cellphones is still low:

In countries where 3G and 4G networks are still developing and broadband use is low but growing, there is immense opportunity to grow the business in the coming years. As telecom companies outside the U.S. see the value in renting space on a tower instead of constructing and owning their own towers, American Tower should have an incredibly stable revenue source and growth platform. That should entice any investor looking over a multidecade time horizon.","Here's why our panelists would trust Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to deliver market-beating returns for at least the next 12 years.

35,"Aug 19, 2017",MarketWatch,"Netflix wants exclusive rights to films, TV shows and the talent creating them","From exclusive original content to exclusive creative talent.

Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.46% is going through another transformation on its way to becoming a mature film and TV studio.

The company this week lured one of TV’s most prolific and successful writers and producers away from Walt Disney Co’s DIS, +4.04% ABC, when it signed an exclusive deal with Shonda Rhimes, creator of hit shows, such as “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” and “How to Get Away with Murder.”

The deal hitches Rhimes to Netflix’s wagon. She will create and produce shows exclusively for Netflix, and will undoubtedly lend her company’s creative vision to Netflix as a whole. The move shows Netflix is looking beyond wooing top Hollywood talent like Martin Scorsese, Will Smith and the Coen brothers, to create one-off projects. Netflix wants to fold creative talent into the very fabric of the company.

Netflix declined to comment for this article.

“Sondaland’s move to Netflix is the result of a shared plan [Netflix chief content officer] Ted Sarandos and I built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company,” Rhimes said in a statement. “Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix’s singular sense of innovation.”

Netflix vs. Hollywood Battle Heating up

In a recent interview with Variety, Sarandos, who lives just blocks away from Rhimes, said he’s sought Rhimes’ input and feedback even during her 15-year tenure creating shows for ABC.

Rhimes’ departure will likely be a significant blow to the network, whose parent company said last week it would remove it’s films and TV shows from the Netflix platform and launch its own streaming service.

There are more than 450 scripted TV series expected to air or stream this year, and they’re all vying for eyeballs and recognition.

The Netflix model has been to simply outspend it’s competition and the company is planning to spend $6 billion on producing and acquiring original programming this year. But it’s also making changes. This year, it began cutting shows that were not performing relative to their production costs, something Netflix had not done before, but a decision that mature networks make every season.

Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said the company needed to consider cutting more shows to make room for other projects. Sarandos said: “Relative to what you spend, are people watching it?... A big show for a huge audience is great. A big, expensive show for a tiny audience is hard, even in our model, to make that work very long.”

Netflix has found success in original content, which began as an experiment just four years ago. The company racked up 91 Emmy nominations this year.

Check out:We asked financial advisers: How realistic is Netflix’s new show ‘Ozark’?

Now Netflix is taking the next step and tearing a page out of Disney’s book, by locking down some of the industry’s best writers, producers and creative talent to create work solely for the platform.

Before the deal with Rhimes, the company announced a similar partnership with comic book legend Mark Millar’s Millarworld. Millar has created some of Hollywood’s most sought after stories, including Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War” and 20th Century Fox’s FOXA, +1.67% “Logan” and “Kingsman.”

“The industry used to be really star driven, but now it’s all about the writers and producers and creative talent.”” — Paul Dergarabedian, ComScore media analyst

Sarandos called Millar the closest thing to a modern day Stan Lee as you can get. Netflix said the Millarworld acquisition — Netflix’s first — was part of its push to work closer with filmmakers and creators. Millar and his team will create and publish stories and characters under the Netflix label, and the films and TV shows will be exclusive to Netflix’s platform.

Also see:Hollywood fighting Netflix is like yelling at an oncoming tsunami

Owning sought after IP and stories beloved by fans gives Netflix opportunities to monetize its content outside of the platform, such as by licensing it to other parties, as it has experimented with already.

Bringing in creative talent to help mold and build a creative identity and slate of films and TV programming is a model that some studios and TV networks have used for decades. Think Disney and Marvel Studio’s Kevin Feige, or Disney and Pixar’s John Lasseter.

Time Warner Inc.-owned US:TWX Warner Bros. last year tapped veteran producer Jon Berg and the creative force behind some of the studio’s successful TV properties, Geoff Johns, to oversee the direction of its valuable DC Extended Universe, which includes films like “Wonder Woman,” “Justice League” and future projects.

Even HBO has come to rely on the creative aspirations of “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.

This model harks back to the Golden Age of Hollywood, when filmmakers and stars had deals to make movies for specific studios.

“Yeah it absolutely harks back to a bygone era when studios had contract players,” said ComScore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “It’s really about locking down the talent. You know, the industry used to be really star driven, but now it’s about the writers and producers and creative talent. It’s all about vision.”

Hollywood has made clear the importance of intellectual property and exclusive content. Netflix has racked up billions of dollars in debt in its quest to secure exclusive original content. And Hollywood studios have arguably over-relied on well-known properties, but these creators and their projects attract reliable eyeballs.

What's Next For Netflix?

Netflix has already frustrated its Hollywood competition by paying dearly to acquire sought after films and series, now the streamer is making a clear play to scoop up the creative talent behind them.

36,"Mar 31, 2018",The Motley Fool,Every Media Company Is Going Direct-to-Consumer,"If cord-cutting weren't enough trouble for media companies, they're now facing pressure from another direction. Last year, TV ad spending decreased for the first time since 2009, and that decline is expected to continue over the next five years, according to estimates from eMarketer.

As more consumers cut the cord and ratings continue to fall for even the most promising live events -- like NFL games -- ad dollars are starting to jump from television to digital. Digital ad spending is expected to climb another 19% this year, according to eMarketer's estimate.

Advertising represents a significant portion of revenue for major media companies like Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), CBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA). Constrained by cord-cutting and decreasing ad spend, media companies are looking for new avenues of growth over the next few years. One promising solution is the direct-to-consumer model.

Going direct-to-consumer

In an effort to combat cord-cutting and the shift of ad dollars to digital, many media companies are working on direct-to-consumer streaming products.

CBS was one of the first media companies to offer a direct-to-consumer service, CBS All Access. Management says it already has about 2.5 million subscribers about three years after launching.

Time Warner has offered HBO Now for some time, but it doesn't show advertisements on that network. The company picked up a 10% stake in Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, Fox, and NBCUniversal, and is expected to produce over $1 billion in ad revenue this year, up 13% from last year.

Most recently, Time Warner announced the launch of the Bleacher Report Live sports streaming service. The service capitalizes on Time Warner's existing relationship with sports leagues and offers customers the option to pay per game, or even pay for parts of games.

Disney has big plans for a direct-to-consumer offering. It will launch ESPN+ in the coming month, and it has a Disney-branded service set to launch near the end of 2019. Disney's forthcoming acquisition of Fox will make available a huge trove of content for the service and provide greater control over Hulu.

Viacom is planning to launch its own ad-supported streaming service before the end of its fiscal year in September. Viacom generates a majority of its revenue from advertising, unlike most other cable network companies, so the shift to digital is an even bigger threat.

Is there enough room for everyone?

Consumers have been saying for a long time that they want some form of a la carte TV, but the actual offerings may prove to be just as expensive and even more of a mess than the traditional cable bundle. Every major TV network will have a direct-to-consumer streaming service by 2022, The Diffusion Group predicts.

Customers may go without channels they'd watch occasionally if they were in a bundle, but won't pay $5 per month for unlimited access to live-streaming and on-demand content. They'll only pay for content they really want.

That bodes well for Disney, which has tremendous brand strength, but Viacom may find it more of a challenge to win subscribers. That's likely why Viacom is considering an ad-supported version of its service in order to subsidize subscription pricing, if it were to go that route. CBS took a similar approach with All Access, and that's worked well so far.

Risky business

There's an additional risk for media companies going direct-to-consumer. Historically, networks have generated additional revenue by licensing content to other streaming services or other networks for syndication. But in order to increase the value of a direct-to-consumer service, a network needs to retain more content for itself.

That would mean media companies will slowly replace a guaranteed source of revenue with a source of revenue that depends on their capability to sell subscriptions or otherwise monetize that content themselves (with ads, for instance). That could make earnings a lot more volatile for media companies, especially more concentrated companies like Viacom or CBS.","Going direct-to-consumerIn an effort to combat cord-cutting and the shift of ad dollars to digital, many media companies are working on direct-to-consumer streaming products.

And while investing in young, growth-oriented companies looking to disrupt an industry or even creating new ones can pay off with big profits, you don't have to count on high-risk ideas to generate enormous wealth.

Case in point: $10,000 divided equally into Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) in 1980 would have made you a millionaire, with total returns of more than $1.4 million at last count. That's pretty remarkable for three companies that had already been around for decades at that point.

But that's only part of the story: That original $10,000 investment would generate nearly $25,000 in annual dividends today. That's the amazing wealth-building power of compounding returns. It's also a reminder that the secret to amazing investing returns isn't really a secret. Investing in great companies at reasonable prices and holding them for as long as possible really does work.

How the House of Mouse became much, much more

Back in 1980, Disney was already a global brand that had been entertaining people for a half-century. Over the past couple of decades, however, Disney has gone from two theme parks and a movie and animation studio to a global entertainment powerhouse. It now owns major broadcast networks, including ABC and ESPN, as well as film studios Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. These acquisitions, as well as the expansion of the Disney theme park business around the world, were the key drivers behind 660% earnings-per-share growth and 818% total returns since 1995.

But worries that the acceleration of the cord-cutting trend -- that is, people dropping cable packages -- will hit Disney's profits have caused the stock price to move up and down a lot the past few years. That trend is already hurting the bottom line, with operating income at the media networks segment having peaked in 2015 and declined the past two years.

The steady stream of cable cancelers will continue to affect ESPN, but the media giant has irons in the fire to cut those losses and find a new source of viewer growth. The first is a transition to stand-alone streaming services, which is particularly appealing to sports fans who want to leave cable behind. And with the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA)(NASDAQ:FOX) movie studios and titles and regional sports networks, Disney's rich collection of content -- both sports and popular movie and TV titles -- is about to get even richer.

A $10,000 investment in Disney in 1980 would be worth almost $1.6 million today in total returns. But with the deepest and most valuable collection of entertainment properties in the world on hand and a deep network of popular sporting content that will eventually be offered via stand-alone streaming, Disney's future looks plenty bright.

Still the best steelmaker to own

Nucor has delivered very similar returns to Disney, with a $10,000 investment in that company in 1980 also being worth nearly $1.6 million in total returns to date. But it has delivered in a vastly different industry that is one of the hardest to consistently make a profit at over the long term: steelmaking.

The short version of Nucor's success is tied to two important things: flexible operating costs and effective capital allocation. Steelmaking is very capital-intensive, with most steelmakers operating high-volume foundries and steel mills with very high fixed expenses. Steel demand is notoriously cyclical and can fall sharply very quickly. This often leaves many steelmakers caught off guard when volume declines, with too much high-cost capacity it can't just switch off overnight. This can swing the industry from big profits to big losses from one quarter to the next.

Nucor's utilization of ""mini mills"" since it entered the steelmaking business in the late 1960s is a huge competitive advantage. These mills don't have the high capacity of more traditional mills but are far more flexible. This makes it much easier for Nucor to navigate the cycles of demand without the big losses its competitors often experience when sales fall.

This has given the company's management -- under three excellent CEOs over the past 50 years -- a steady stream of cash to use, often when the market was down and Nucor could acquire assets at bargain prices. This has led to Nucor's becoming America's largest steel producer, as well as its largest recycler. Recycled steel makes up over 75% of the company's feedstock each year.

Since 2010, Nucor has made over a dozen acquisitions, expanding its capacity and capabilities in higher-profit, higher-demand steel segments while many of its competitors have struggled to profit. Nucor remains the best steelmaker in the U.S. and is poised to profit for years to come, even as the steel market goes through its ups and downs.

The payments megatrend is a huge opportunity for AmEx

$10,000 invested in American Express in 1980 hasn't turned out quite as well as Nucor or Disney to date, with total returns of ""only"" 10,580%. However, it still would have made you a millionaire, with total returns worth just over $1 million at recent prices.

American Express is positioned to reward investors very well in the decades to come. Since 1980, much of the company's success has been in the U.S. and other developed nations. But that's very likely to change. In its most recent quarter, the company reported $708.3 billion in billed business in the U.S., versus $376.9 billion outside the U.S. However, international billed business increased 12% last year and now makes up more than one-third of total billed business. This is a major trend that's likely to accelerate.

Within 20 years, 1 billion more people will live in urban settings. The global middle class is growing quickly, and technology is driving a shift toward electronic payments. American Express is likely to be one of the big winners from this trend. It may not turn $10,000 into $1 million over the next few decades, but it has a lot of things in its favor to make it an incredible investment nonetheless.","Case in point: $10,000 divided equally into Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) in 1980 would have made you a millionaire, with total returns of more than $1.4 million at last count.

39,"Apr 18, 2018",MarketWatch,Everything you need to know about attorney-client privilege (and when it no longer applies),"The investigation into President Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has highlighted the concept of attorney-client privilege, which Trump declared “dead” in a tweet after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Cohen’s office. But if Fox News FOXA, +1.67% host Sean Hannity’s comments on the matter are any indication, consumers may not fully understand the often-cited legal concept.

“For lawyers, attorney-client privilege is a core concept that enables them to do their jobs by providing clients the assurance of privacy.”

Under the order of senior U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, Cohen revealed that Hannity was one of his clients after fighting to keep that and other information confidential based on the notion of attorney-client privilege.

On Twitter TWTR, +2.63% , Hannity claimed that, while Cohen had never represented him in any matter nor been paid any legal fees, he had assumed their conversations would be confidential. That is not always the case, experts told MarketWatch.

What is attorney-client privilege?

Attorney-client privilege is the principle that a lawyer cannot present confidential communications with a client in court as evidence without the expressed consent from that client. It’s a principle in common law — meaning it is based on past court precedents — though some states have codified it as a rule.

“Under attorney-client privilege, a lawyer cannot present confidential communications with a client in court as evidence without that client’s express consent.”

For lawyers, attorney-client privilege is a core concept that enables them to do their jobs by providing clients the assurance of privacy. “We hold it in such high regard and treat it as something that’s sacrosanct,” said Kaylin Whittingham, a New York-based lawyer who specializes in legal ethics.

This privilege typically relates to information relayed to an attorney directly by a client, so information received from another source is generally not shielded by this. For example, if a client’s unlawful act was caught on security camera, he or she wouldn’t be protected by attorney-client privilege since another source could confirm that.

Here are the tax-saving strategies that most Americans don't know

The concept of attorney-client privilege is slightly different from the duty of confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality bars a lawyer from revealing any confidential information pertaining to a client at any time, regardless of the source. Also, it applies outside the courtroom. Moreover, under the duty of confidentiality, lawyers must keep information under wraps indefinitely — even after a client has died.

“An attorney doesn’t necessarily have to receive payment from the client for the principles to be in effect and, therefore, for that person to be considered a client.”

An attorney doesn’t necessarily have to receive payment from the client for the principles to be in effect and, therefore, for that person to be considered a client.

There are exceptions, however. If someone is speaking with a friend who is a lawyer to get their legal opinion on a pressing matter, they don’t automatically receive attorney-client privilege, Whittingham said. But if one were to then inquire with a friend about hiring them, they might then expect that to be kept private. Someone in this position should determine whether the privilege will apply before divulging information to a lawyer.

“The information becomes confidential when it’s gained when representing a client or in communications related to seeking representation,” Whittingham said.

Can courts require lawyers to divulge information?

In rare circumstances, courts can order attorneys to reveal confidential information relayed by their clients.

“‘The information becomes confidential when it’s gained when representing a client or in communications related to seeking representation.’” — Kaylin Whittingham, a New York-based lawyer who specializes in legal ethics.

And as officers of the court, a lawyer is compelled to provide the requested information in such a situation. “We are officers of the court, so if we have a court order we have to comply with it,” said Whittingham.

However, a judge cannot needlessly require an attorney to break their client’s confidence. And when it comes to investigating a lawyer for a potential or alleged crime, the U.S. Department of Justice advises that law enforcement must make special efforts to avoid breaking attorney-client privilege if it is unrelated to the case at hand.

What happens when a client breaks the law?

Most often, when courts do ask an attorney to break privilege without a client’s consent, it’s because of a suspicion a crime or fraud that is being committed.

Under “crime-fraud exception,” an attorney is required to disclose information if a client reveals that he or she is planning to carry out a crime or fraud, or is even in the process of doing so. However, an attorney is not required to reveal whether a past crime has been committed.

“Under ‘crime-fraud exception,’ an attorney is required to disclose information if a client reveals that he or she is planning to carry out a crime or fraud, or is in the process of doing so”

“If, for instance, the client tells a lawyer they committed murder, the attorney cannot disclose,” said Donna Ballman, a Fort Lauderdale-based lawyer who specializes in employment law. “If the client says they intend to kill a witness to the murder, the lawyer must disclose.”

When it comes to perjury, attorneys have limited options, and some states require lawyers to reveal when this occurs, Ballman said. Attorneys have an ethical obligation to correct the court records whenever a client has lied, but attorneys can also instruct their clients not to incriminate themselves or to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights.

Moreover, much like non-lawyers, attorneys aren’t allowed to break the law. If anything, they could see more stringent punishment in such an event and could lose their license to practice if they do so because they are held to a higher standard as officers of the court.","The investigation into President Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has highlighted the concept of attorney-client privilege, which Trump declared “dead” in a tweet after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Cohen’s office.

Stocks were mostly lower on Friday, Nov. 17, pulling back from a rally in retail and tech a day earlier that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by triple digits and pushed the Nasdaq to a new closing high.

Though the overall retail industry finished the week on a high note, that didn't stop walls from closing in on Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) just a little bit more. A full month after announcing that he will leave the board of directors, Sears' shareholder Bruce Berkowitz is further distancing himself from the declining retailer. This time, he's doing so with his wallet.

The investor behind mutual fund Fairholme Capital Management LLC is dumping $1.78 million worth of shares, or 462,000 total, of the company, according to a Nov. 14 SEC filing. Berkowitz now owns a 22.57% stake in Sears, down from 27% in October. Fairholme is still Sears' largest holder behind CEO Eddie Lampert, who controls 30% of the company.

While Sears insists that Berkowitz's decision was not the result of any disagreement with Sears on its policies or operations, the decision to sell more shares seemed to cause more unrest as Sears closed down more than 5% on Friday. The shares are down more than 50% year-to-date.

If the company can't complete the deal it would be on the hook for close to $1 billion, which would include retiring debt tied to its potential buyout as well as interest payments on other debt.

AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson has expressed a willingness to mix it up with the DOJ, although the track record of companies succeeding in their fights haven't worked out so well in the past.

A month later the oilfield services company agreed to drop the purchase, paying a hefty termination fee and redeeming $2.5 billion of debt it issued to finance the deal at a premium, and wound up paying $41 million in fees and associated expenses.

Back in 2011, AT&T did not fight the DOJ's lawsuit to block its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (TMUS) - Get T-Mobile US, Inc. Report . The telecom had to terminate a $20 billion credit agreement with a group of banks.

41,"Mar 11, 2018",The Motley Fool,Netflix's $8 Billion Content Budget to Fund 700 TV Shows and Movies,"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) already produced enough content in 2017 for people to rack up 50 billion viewing hours for the January-to-December period. But the company wants to release even more content in 2018.

To be exact, Netflix plans to release 700 TV, film, and stand-up comedy projects this year. That's according to comments made by Netflix CFO David Wells on Feb. 27 during the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference.

Content rules when it comes to subscribers, because they naturally gravitate toward the streamers with the best content. With Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, and (soon) Disney (NYSE:DIS) on its heels, Netflix is smart to ramp up its content game, as a way to keep its current subscribers interested while luring in new subscribers.

Netflix's $8 billion content budget expected to drive subs

In 2018, Netflix expects to spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content, Wells said on the latest earnings call. That impressive budget will go toward funding 700 projects Wells later revealed at the Morgan Stanley conference in February.

Of those 700 projects, Wells revealed, 80 will be non-English-language original content geared toward international markets. This will help Netflix continue to expand in the less-saturated markets outside of its home country. In the last quarter, Netflix added 6.36 million international subscribers and 1.98 million U.S. subscribers.

Netflix is willing to allocate billions for its content budget each year because that's directly leading to more subscribers. ""Let's continue to add content -- it's working, it's driving growth,"" Wells said to the audience at the conference.

Netflix stunned some investors back in 2016 when it spent $5 billion on content and estimated it would raise that to $6 billion in 2017. However, with the continued growth in subscribers, investors have become less stingy about the company's content budget. In fact, last quarter's figure of 8.33 million subscriber additions was a new record for Netflix.

The company ended 2017 with 117.6 million global subscribers, but Wells said there are still more non-Netflix subscribers in the world than there are subscribers. He noted that there are an estimated 700 million broadband users across the world (excluding China), implying that the company has a long runway when it comes to subscriber growth.

Netflix has also found that marketing spend is essential to promote the high-quality content that it's paying billions for each year. The company said in its note to investors last quarter that it's increasing the marketing budget from about $1.3 billion in 2017 to approximately $2 billion for 2018.

Netflix's content formula requires pricey talent

In addition to sizable content and marketing budgets, Netflix's golden formula also includes pricey talent. The company has discovered that hiring the best production talent makes its job easy. ""Hire great people, give them the resources to make great content and get out of their way,"" Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said about the company's content strategy on the last earnings call.

Most recently, Netflix signed a multiyear contract with creator Ryan Murphy, who was previously at Twenty-First Century Fox and is behind hit shows like Feud and American Horror Story. Murphy is getting paid a stunning $300 million for his five-year contract with Netflix, because he ""has been a very successful and prolific producer of television that has been very commercially successful,"" Wells said.

Such a lucrative deal isn't the new norm. Wells said Murphy is an exception, because he has the track record to prove that he knows how to make content that appeals to large audiences. ""We were pleased with the type of content he creates in terms of being popular globally, not just in the U.S. He creates a lot of customer joy, as we like to say,"" Wells explained.

Prior to Murphy, Netflix had signed a deal with Shonda Rhimes that's said to be worth $100 million. The former ABC Studios creator is known for global hits like Grey's Anatomy and Scandal. Wells said Netflix was willing to do a big deal with Rhimes for the same reason: She has the track record to prove that she knows how to create content that appeals to global audiences.

Netflix also has multiyear deals with Orange is the New Black creator and GLOW executive producer Jenji Kohan, and with Stranger Things executive producer Shawn Levy. There has also been some talent poaching. In September, Netflix hired Melissa Cobb, head of studio at Oriental DreamWorks (a joint venture of DreamWorks, a subsidiary of Comcast), to be in charge of its series and films for children and families.

While spending $8 billion on content or $300 million on a three-year contract might seem excessive now, it won't be a year from now, when Disney is set to pull its content from Netflix and launch its own competing streaming site. Netflix already has a number of competitors, but Disney may be its biggest one yet, with its blockbuster movie business, extensive intellectual property, and pending acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox.

Netflix is taking some big steps to stay ahead of the increasing competition. That's a good thing, because as we learned when Amazon bought Whole Foods last June, sometimes it just takes one overnight move for an underdog to suddenly come out on top in a market.","Content rules when it comes to subscribers, because they naturally gravitate toward the streamers with the best content.

Following Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report industry-shaking $66 billion purchase of most of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report , it's little surprise that Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) would draw attention.

(VIAB) - Get Viacom Inc. Class B Report are among the potential suitors, according to Deadline Hollywood. Hollywood has been consolidating for years, and John Malone-backed Lions Gate is among the few digestible companies with an appealing studio and library.

""There is going to be a lot of concern among traditional industry players, telecoms and frankly even Silicon Valley tech-oriented companies that we're at the beginning of another cycle of land grab and if you don't participate you're going to be left out starting from scratch on your own,"" said Moody's Investors Service analyst Neil Begley.

Lions Gate's films include ""La La Land"" and ""Hunger Games,"" ""The Twilight Saga"" and ""Saw"" franchises. The company's television unit produced ""Orange is the New Black"" for Netflix Inc. (NFLX) - Get Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Report and ""Mad Men"" for AMC (AMCX) - Get AMC Networks Inc. Class A Report . Lions Gate's film and TV library includes 16,000 titles. The studio bought cable network operator Starz for $4.4 billion in 2016. The company declined to comment for this story.

""Lionsgate-Starz's unique content-distribution combo make it a prized asset against another wave of consolidation,"" Macquarie Capital analyst Amy Yong wrote in a Friday note.

With a $7.5 billion market cap and a $10.5 billion total valuation including debt, Lions Gate is digestible.

The company also has deal-savvy ownership and management, as Yong noted.

Mark Rachesky's MHR Fund Management is the largest shareholder with an 18.6% stake. MHR has a ""private equity approach to investing in distressed and undervalued middle-market companies,"" according to Rachesky's bio on the Lions Gate web site. Rachesky successfully battled Carl Icahn for control of the company's board in 2010 and 2011.

Legendary media deal maker Malone has a 7.86% position and a seat on the board. Liberty Global plc (LBTYA) - Get Liberty Global Plc Class A Report , which Malone chairs, owns another 3.07%.

Amazon is locked in a streaming arms race with Netflix and would benefit by adding Lions Gate. The company declined to comment.

Verizon rival AT&T Inc. (T) - Get AT&T Inc. Report has launched megadeals, buying DirecTV Group Inc. for $67.1 billion, including debt, agreeing to pay $108.7 billion, including debt, for Time Warner Inc. (TWX) -- if it can overcome a Department of Justice lawsuit blocking the deal.

Verizon has favored smaller acquisitions such as the $4.48 billion purchase of Yahoo! Inc. and its $4.4 billion acquisition of AOL.

Viacom and CBS are a wild card. CBS declined to comment and Viacom did not respond to a query.

Controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reportedly aims to merge the companies in a deal that has drawn mixed reviews. Adding Lions Gate would juice up a combined CBS-Viacom.

""We are wary of the merits of CBS/Viacom, but the inclusion of Lions Gate, if true, could be interesting,"" Macquarie Capital analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a Friday report. Lions Gate's acumen in TV and film production and intellectual property would help Viacom's Paramount, he noted, while Starz could distribute Paramount's films. Combined with CBS and Viacom's cable networks, Starz and Lions Gate would have a larger base of content to support a streaming video service.

Along with its studio, library and distribution, Lions Gate has another selling point: scarcity value. Aside from Lions Gate and privately held Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., there is a paucity of studios with attractive libraries for a major telecom, Silicon Valley power or traditional media company to pick up.

45,"Apr 5, 2018",Nasdaq,The Money Behind the Masters,"The Masters' tagline has been ""a tradition unlike any other"" for years. The validity of this claim aside, the first major championship of the year at Augusta National Golf Club is unique to the rest of major sports and golf as a whole for the simple fact that it does not pursue the most money possible.

Augusta keeps many of its financial dealings under wraps, but the Masters reportedly generated revenues of roughly $115 million in 2015, according to a Golf Digestreport . The club also leaves millions of dollars on the table when you consider the relatively cheap ticket prices, insanely inexpensive food, and absence of online merchandise.

So where does the money come from and where does all of it go?

Augusta

The most basic revenue breakdown is as follows: merchandise ($47.5 million); tickets ($34.75 million); international TV rights ($25 million); and concessions ($7.75 million).

Augusta pours millions and millions of dollars into the course every year. Another large chunk of the money goes directly to the players. The Masters will shell out a total of $11million in prize money this year, which is the second-highest on tour.

Masters tickets, one of the largest revenue generators despite their relatively low costs, are usually won and purchased through a lottery system. But tickets always end up on secondary markets. Four day badges for the Masters had been selling for about $6,500 right up until the start of Thursday's first-round, on various ticket sites.

One of the most obvious ways that Augusta leaves money on the greens is through its now iconically-cheap food and drink offerings.

Television

CBS CBS will broadcast weekend coverage of the Masters for the 63 rd year in a row. The network and Augusta have worked on one-year deals pretty much the entire time, and look as if they will continue this relationship in perpetuity.

Interestingly, neither CBS nor Augusta reportedly make money from their relationship. This breakeven partnership is based on mutual prestige, which seems hardly enough when looking at the massive 12-year, $1.1 billion deal Fox FOXA and the USGA signed in 2013.

The 2018 Masters also marks roughly 10 years since ESPN DIS took over Thursday and Friday coverage. Details about the deal aren't clear, but ESPN certainly dedicates a lot of resources to its nearly around-the-clock coverage.

Fans can also watch nearly all of the coverage on Masters.com, which shows far more total hours than ESPN and CBS.

Sponsors

Delta DAL became the newest official sponsor of the Masters last October. The airline's addition brought the overall total to six. UPS UPS , AT&T T , IBM IBM , Mercedes-Benz, and Rolex all spend between $6 and $8 million a year, but have zero signage in view on the property.

This investment grants the Masters' partners the rights to split four minutes of ads per broadcast hour, which is far less time than most other sporting events.

Three of the biggest sportswear giants, Nike NKE , Adidas ADDYY , and Under Armour UAA will also all be on full display during the four-day tournament. Lastly, many of the players themselves will have a slew of corporate logos, from KPMG and other financial firms to golf companies such as Callaway ELY , all over their bodies.

Ratings

Of all the mystique surrounding the Masters, one thing that seems all too clear is that both CBS and ESPN hope this year's tournament grabs better ratings.

The Masters suffered it lowest TV ratings in 13 years in 2017. But this year's event promises to be different because the sport's biggest star, Tiger Woods, is back at Augusta-and this time he looks healthy.

46,"Nov 15, 2017",TheStreet,Who Might Buy CNN?,"AT&T says it won't sell the cable news network, but who -- Murdoch, Bloomberg, Bezos -- may be lining up in case CEO Randall Stephenson changes his mind?

We know that Randall Stephenson says CNN's not for sale, even though he doesn't even own it yet. As the news emerged last week that the Department of Justice's antitrust division has been jawboning with AT&T Inc. (T) - Get AT&T Inc. Report on its agreed-to purchase of Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , with CNN an apparent sticking point, the question quickly followed: What would Stephenson, AT&T's CEO, do?

Would he take the DOJ's objection to court, or would he agree to divest the sticking parts of the deal, most likely CNN and parent Turner Broadcasting System Inc.?

Stephenson answered the question quickly: To the courts, he said on Thursday, Nov. 9. And that seemed to be the immediate end of the question, though even Stephenson acknowledged would-be offers for the assets already had arrived in his office.

In fact, in this nothing-is-stable media world, all bets need to be off on who might own what come 2020. This is a media industry -- TV, film, magazine and newspaper -- in the throes of upheaval. Pick your theory of the case about the 2020-2025 reality -- the primacy of content, the age of platforms, the need for scale in distribution, the necessity of direct consumer relationships, an age of real convergence -- and ambitious strategists could make all kinds of combinations justifiable.

Just days before the news of the Justice Department potentially blocking AT&T, we heard that Walt Disney Co. (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Reporthad been in talks to buy substantial Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report assets. Further, the president's chosen Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai, is busily demolishing most of the rules on limiting the concentration on media ownership, opening the potential of deals we previously thought impossible.

At the moment, an odd economic-high, politically low moment in America, it looks like big prized names in the American media business could be in play. That's a big story that will play out into 2018, as strategists guess at what the 2020 landscape will look like.

For now, let's ask the question, though, of CNN. What if AT&T decides that its court battles, while potentially winnable, will just take too long? What if it calculates its deal value is too diminished to bet on the judiciary? What if someone else comes along to make it an offer that makes it easier to bid CNN goodbye?

Stephenson has newly acknowledged that possibility. AT&T, he told CNN last week, would use ""another avenue"" to ""accomplish the same thing,"" that is diversifying its huge but maturing business base.

If AT&T did sell, would it have to sell all of Turner Broadcasting, which includes TNT and TBS, in addition to CNN? We'll leave that question for another time and here focus on CNN.

Founded in 1980 by Ted Turner, its numbers are impressive. It rings in $1 billion in operating profit and has made substantial progress in its digital transition, now earning about $350 million in digital revenue a year. (That figure is $150 million less than The New York Times (NYT) - Get New York Times Company Class A Report .) It tops the comScore Inc. charts for total audience. Further, this year, even in -- and because of -- the fake news hysteria, CNN has distinguished itself as, along with Times and The Washington Post, with its aggressive, sometimes scoopy coverage of national politics.

How much is CNN worth? Over time, analysts have pegged it at $8 billion to $10 billion. That means relatively few companies, or individuals, could buy it alone.

Importantly, too, as a cable network, it's freer of the regulatory reach involved in the selling and buying of broadcast assets. Further, CNN's long-standing affiliate network provides built-in national/local connections, potentially valuable to some buyers.

Let's look across the media map of logical and long-shot would-be buyers of CNN. Let's make a short list of what kinds of combinations, most potential, a few fanciful, may be possible. And let's remember: Whatever CNN is today could change tomorrow. The words making up its acronym themselves are laughably generic: cable news network. With changed ownership and leadership and changing faces, the CNN we've known could rapidly fade into history.

Bloomberg LP

One gating principle: ability to buy. Check. Bloomberg Media CEO Justin Smith and global head of digital Scott Havens continue to quickly build out the nonterminal business of Bloomberg. Just this week, they announced a new hiring of 50 journalists to create ""first 24-hour social news network on Twitter."" Smith now positions his company alongside the embattled platforms: ""In this age of the Google/Facebook duopoly, a relentless focus on invention and innovation is the only way to succeed. The fruits of disruption don't and shouldn't only belong to the dominant tech platforms.""

One under-reported part of Bloomberg's growth: global licensing of its content and platform. While that push focuses almost exclusively on business news, a Bloomberg/CNN combo could dominate both general news and business, with even greater distribution and advertising sales power.

Private ownership also would insulate CNN from ever-intensifying winds of political pushback and potential corporate timidity, should an AT&T or others take control. Namesake founder Michael Bloomberg, who made Businessweek ""Bloomberg Businessweek,"" may like the sound of ""Bloomberg CNN.""

Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc.

What don't Sinclair (SBGI) - Get Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. Class A Report chairman David D. Smith and CEO Christopher Ripley want to buy? While greatly challenged, they're perilously close to closing on their acquisition of Tribune Media Co. (TRCO) - Get Tribune Media Co. Class A Report . That would give them a reach into 72% of U.S. households, all through local broadcast stations. In total, with the addition of Tribune Media's 42 stations, Sinclair would own 233 TV stations. That's a number without precedent in local broadcasting and only possible given the paving of its way by FCC Chairman Pai.

Sinclair already has ramped up its national presence (and nationally mandated, must-carry, fact-challenged editorials) with a new national digital presence -- Circa.

In recent months, conjecture has heightened about Sinclair's wont to compete with Fox News for its audience. One big hurdle: carriage. CNN would solve that problem.

Verizon Communications Inc.

The company (VZ) - Get Verizon Communications Inc. Report finds itself in the same pickle as AT&T. Its businesses are maturing, it needs growth -- and it wants to get more digital. CEO Lowell McAdam already has bet on content, first answering Tim Armstrong's siren call and buying AOL Inc., and then Yahoo Inc.'s core business. A CNN purchase could be transformative. Yet, logically -- to the logic, such as it is, of the DOJ's objection to AT&T-Time Warner -- Verizon would find itself similarly disqualified by the feds. Further, Stephenson wouldn't want to end up making one of his chief competitors potentially stronger.

Comcast Corp.

It's another AT&T competitor, with ambitions of greater dominance. AT&T would then have similar competitive concerns. Further, Comcast (CMCSA) - Get Comcast Corporation Class A Report owns NBC, and with it MSNBC. One line of thought: It has what it needs in national and global news gathering and in national distribution. The other: In a world of consolidation, bigger is always better. Why play second fiddle to CNN in total audience and other categories? Why not combine two legacy news operations and build a single digital/TV operation that is truly dominant globally?

Disney

We know that Disney actively seeks more film and TV assets -- more content for global distribution as it contests Netflix Inc. (NFLX) - Get Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Report and the emergent digital-only movie business. Witness its talks with Fox, which some note will be ongoing. Yes, it's seen a reversal of fortune with cable -- ESPN, ancestral cousin of CNN at its founding, is losing its luster -- but it does own ABC News. We could argue that ABC needs scale, or a sale, to survive in digital times.

CBS Corp.

CBS News (CBS) - Get CBS Corporation Class B Report serves as another once-great (Big Three!) still finding its way in the new world, though, like ABC and NBC, it can count a large digital audience. ""CNN is the perfect complement to CBS News, lots of cost savings,"" said one exec quite familiar with both.

Viacom Inc.

It's all cable, but after the CBS split, Viacom (VIAB) - Get Viacom Inc. Class B Report doesn't have the news genes. ""Wrong culture,"" one exec summed up.

Hearst Corp.

This huge, private, most media-diversified of companies has made lots of money in cable as well. CNN would be a big stretch, especially for a company known for its fiscal discipline and sober strategies. Yet the company has shown signs of wanting to be more of a player in the unfolding media age, so don't count it out.

Fox

Yes, we know that Rupert Murdoch is, oddly it seems, considering selling some of his prized Fox assets, but never underestimate trader Rupe.

He's already been accused of whispering in Trump's ear about the perils of AT&T's bid. At the same time, it's been reported that Fox is among the companies that may have newly sniffed around CNN, should it break loose. Yes, the next generation of Murdochs awaits, but consider that Rupert Murdoch may now confront the most wide-open American buying -- and merging -- opportunity of his lifetime, courtesy of the deregulation he has advocated for decades.

A Fox/CNN merger? Odder than a sale but indeed possible. Think assets and audiences -- not the political hoo-hah of the day -- and a different possibility emerges.

New York Times Co.

We know the Sulzbergers, by themselves, couldn't pull off such a purchase, but consider the potential news powerhouse that would be created.

Trump times have crystallized the news media world, promoting the top brands. At the same time, it is global journalism that offers the most potential return in 2020 to 2030, as Times CEO Mark Thompson said, speaking of ""hundreds of millions of college-educated English speakers"" recently. While the Times' ""The Daily"" news podcast has offered up revelatory success extending the Times beyond text to audio, the video frontier is one it should master. CNN's a force, but it doesn't have the stature of the Times. Together, they would have the largest journalistic workforce in the world. Admittedly, this isn't a new idea -- I suggested a partnership five years ago -- but it's one to newly ponder.

Lastly, both news institutions could see themselves strengthened against a new competitor -- The Washington Post.

Jeff Bezos

Which, of course, brings us to the billionaire who's shown what modest investment and confidence can do quickly in propelling an older-school news brand into digital prominence.

""The Post is a vanity buy,"" suggested one savvy news executive, when I suggested a Bezos buy. ""CNN will need a business case.""

Perhaps, but at the age of 53 and almost $100 billion in wealth, Bezos may be tempted to do in the digital age what Turner audaciously did 37 years ago. Here, too, we see the potential of a clear No. 1 news giant, just as the Post itself has begun seeing itself as much a global player as a national one. Think of the synergies. As one wag suggested, ""He could make ad-free OTT available to Prime members or Kindle hardware owners!""

Vladimir Putin

If an American billionaire can do it, why not a Russian one? The Justice Department has finally acknowledged what RT (Russia TV) has long been, an agent of state propaganda, and forced it to register as a foreign agent. Putin's now playing the game of the day: false equivalence. He's talked about demanding the license of U.S. media trying to cover his country. Wouldn't it be easier just to own a worldwide cable news network?

While there may be some bothersome laws making such an acquisition difficult, perhaps Putin's friend in the White House could smooth the path.

More plausibly, an exec pointed to other foreign parties: ""I wouldn't rule out Alibaba (BABA) - Get Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Sponsored ADR Report or Tencent. Either can easily buy it, and even the Justice Department will be very hard-pressed to make a case on the regulatory or the foreign ownership front.""

47,"Jan 25, 2018",TheStreet,Lions Gate Shares Pop as Vice Chair Discusses Possible Acquirers,"Lions Gate Vice Chairman Michael Burns fanned expectations for media consolidation in an interview on CNBC, addressing potential tie-ups with Amazon, CBS, Comcast and Verizon.

Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGFA) Vice Chairman Michael Burns piqued anticipation that the studio behind ""Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight"" would be scooped up by a larger media, telecom or tech company in an interview on CNBC on Wednesday evening.

""We talk to everybody,"" Burns said when asked if Lions Gate had been in talks with CNBC parent Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) - Get Comcast Corporation Class A Report . Lions Gate shares were up almost 3% to $35.90 on Thursday late morning.

Lions Gate would be a ""a bolt-on"" for Comcast, said Burns, who also discussed the potential for deals with Verizon Communications (VZ) - Get Verizon Communications Inc. Report , Comcast (CMCSA) - Get Comcast Corporation Class A Report , Amazon (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report and CBS Corp. (CBS) - Get CBS Corporation Class B Report . Lions Gate, which has backing from legendary deal maker John Malone, would be a ""pint-sized bite for some of these giant market cap companies,"" Burns said.

The media industry is at a crossroads. AT&T Inc. (T) - Get AT&T Inc. Report is battling the Department of Justice to complete its acquisition of HBO parent Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion, or $108.7 billion including assumed debt. Burns said that AT&T had become an ""800-pound gorilla"" with its acquisition of DirecTV Group; if it can close the Time Warner purchase, Burns said the gorilla essentially be ""handed a bazooka, which is HBO.""

Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report is buying Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report film and television studios, international satellite TV operations and other assets for $66 billion. The move has raised speculation that other companies in the video streaming business will make acquisitions to gain scale, with Lions Gate and privately held MGM Studios Inc. coming into focus as potential targets.

The deals present a dilemma for companies such as Amazon and Verizon that are building online video businesses.

""A lot of these companies, particularly in the tech space, have to ask themselves do they want to build it or do they want to buy it?"" Burns said on CNBC. ""Then the question is how far ahead are others if they want to be in the streaming business or the subscription business in a bigger way, how far ahead are others. And if they believe they are pretty far ahead, my guess is they would buy it as opposed to build it.""

Lions Gate and Amazon already have a deep relationship. Lions Gate produced The Big Sick and Manchester by the Sea for Amazon Studios. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services provides cloud computing services to Lions Gate. ""We're a customer of Amazon's and we think there is more to do with them,"" Burns said.

Burns noted that Verizon Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam said during Tuesday earnings call he is not considering a big media deal.

""It would be interesting to hear the definition of 'big,'"" Burns said.

Burns makes a good point. Lions Gate has a $7 billion market cap, and is worth $10 billion including debt. That's about the total amount that Verizon paid for Yahoo! Inc. ($4.48 billion) and AOL ($4.4 billion).

CBS and Viacom Inc. (VIAB) - Get Viacom Inc. Class B Report could reunite, Burns suggested, noting that Shari Redstone and the Redstone family control the companies. The Redstones tried to combine the two in 2016. Burns said that a current deal could be a two-way merger or a three-way merger, perhaps implying that Lions Gate could join with CBS and Viacom.

""I don't have a crystal ball,"" Burns said of the latest round of deal speculation. ""John Malone is the only one I know who has one of those.""

The old ways with a handful of major movie studios competing for your ticket dollars at the box office and in cable TV syndication are giving way to streaming media platforms and high-quality drama series. Some of the names remain the same, but there are many relative newcomers as well.

Let's have a look at the state of Hollywood today.

Hollywood by the numbers

Company Market Cap Business Focus Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) $581 billion Streaming media Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) $191 billion Content production and distribution Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) $169 billion Content production and distribution Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) $87 million Streaming media Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) $72 billion Content production and distribution Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) $67 billion Content production and distribution Sony (NYSE:SONY) $58 billion Content production and distribution Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA) (NASDAQ:VIAB) $13 billion Content production and distribution Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE:LGF-A) (NYSE:LGF-B) $6.6 billion Content production and distribution Dolby Laboratories (NYSE:DLB) $6.4 billion Media technologies Regal Entertainment (NYSE: RGC) $3.6 billion Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) $2.0 billion Movie theater chain IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) $1.5 billion Media technologies

What is Hollywood, exactly?

Technically speaking, Hollywood is a suburb of Los Angeles, California. The town has been the historic home of many major movie studios and is still seen as an avatar of the film industry as a whole.

The big names here roll easily off the tongue: Disney, Time Warner, and Fox have been titans of this industry for decades. The same goes for Comcast's Universal Pictures division, the Paramount arm of Viacom, and Sony's Columbia Pictures.

That's the current Big Six lineup, with a combined 80.5% share of ticket sales in 2017. The box office total that year added up to $11.0 billion, down from $11.2 billion in 2016. Throw in the ascending mini-major Lions Gate, and you'd get 88.5% of last year's ticket sales going to the Big Seven.

These studios produce blockbusters for the silver screen, along with a heaping serving of smaller titles. When the theatrical run is over, these movies move on to DVD and Blu-ray sales, before making the next hop to premium cable TV and streaming video partners. Beyond that, some movies have their syndication rights picked up by over-the-air TV networks and various international destinations.

The larger blockbuster movies have their viewing sales padded by licensed production of consumer goods. Superheroes and cartoon characters are often seen on lunch boxes and t-shirts, and action movies can spawn successful lines of action figures, toy cars, and sticker-laden drones.

So when you think about Hollywood, you're really thinking about several separate industries working together to entertain the world. From production studios and distributors to theater chains and viewing-tech researchers, Hollywood goes by many names.

Let's take an even closer look at some of Hollywood's biggest names, which look like great investments here at the start of 2018.

Walt Disney

The House of Mouse does everything, and is an industry leader in every sense of that epithet.

It's the largest ticket seller by a long shot, managing 22% of last year's box office. I don't think I need to remind you of Disney's prowess in monetizing that blockbuster content via the usual distributions pipeline -- plus an unmatched collection of theme parks, themed cruise lines, and hotel experiences soaked in the company's unique flavor.

Right now, the company is up to its knees in new business ideas. Disney has launched a $52 billion buyout offer for most of Twenty-First Century Fox's assets, excluding some TV properties. At the same time, the company's premium distribution contract with Netflix will expire at the end of 2018, to be replaced by a new Disney-owned streaming service.

In short, Disney isn't resting on its laurels.

That could have been the easy way out for a company sporting three of last year's four biggest blockbusters. But Disney has a history of producing fresh value from mergers and buyouts, including the game-changing additions of Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm, ESPN, and the ABC network. These buyouts account for the majority of Disney's business operations nowadays, and there's no reason to doubt that the Fox transaction will be successful.

As for the new direction in streaming video options, Disney arguably wants to become a credible Netflix rival before Netflix starts to threaten Disney's own core business. The partnership has been good for both companies so far, but it's probably a smart move to part ways at this point.

If anyone can do without a Netflix partnership, it's Disney. This is a company for the ages, and the stock is selling at a discount right now.

Netflix

Meanwhile, Netflix is taking the world by storm and investing billions in freshly made content.

This is not a traditional Hollywood name, but Netflix has become a crucial partner to the movie industry at large. Many studios think of this company as a frenemy, as its streaming services are undermining traditional distribution partners such as theater chains and premium cable channels.

So former buddies like Disney are taking a step back to reassess the streaming market. Netflix is the domestic leader by miles and miles, and its global ambitions are hard to beat. Amazon's Prime Video may match Netflix's count of international territories, but the service isn't pulling its own weight yet and might never catch up to Netflix in most markets. I say that as a shareholder in both companies; Prime Video just isn't among the reasons why I own Amazon.

Netflix is a pioneer and innovator in the streaming video space, blazing new business trails in directions most rivals wouldn't touch. Rather than stringing viewers along with weekly episodes of popular shows, this company drops in entire seasons all at once. Instead of drenching its websites and streaming apps in ads and direct links to video-buying options, the Netflix experience is as simple and uncluttered as possible. Downright heresy to many sector peers, these things are an integral part of Netflix's business identity.

At 106 million worldwide subscribers at the end of 2017, Netflix is just getting started. It's a big world out there, with improving economies and increasing reach of broadband internet services even in emerging markets like Africa and southern Asia. Meanwhile, its $4.5 billion annual content budget will only increase as the incoming sales rise.

52,"Apr 15, 2018",MarketWatch,"The ESPN streaming service is not new, Disney just wants you to pay for it","Remember when Netflix Inc. split its DVD-by-mail service and then-new streaming plan, enraging subscribers who had been receiving both to pay more for the same level of service?



Well, there isn’t much different in what the Walt Disney Co. DIS, +4.04% is doing with its new ESPN+ streaming service, which is likely to grow and change just as Netflix’s NFLX, +0.46% streaming service has since 2011.

ESPN launched the direct-to-consumer offering Thursday, its first foray into so-called over-the-top, or OTT, streaming services. It is an attempt to address one of the biggest complaints from Disney investors over the past two years: Consumers cutting the cable cord and therefore slicing the amount of cash Disney receives for its sports programming.

Amid the cord-cutting phenomenon, Disney has also been dealing with stratospheric increases in the costs for sports content, with professional and college leagues demanding more for the live games that are the largest portion of a dwindling amount of television shows that viewers still watch as they occur (and accept the commercials that are included). The twin pressures of fewer consumers willing to pay for ESPN content and greater costs to provide that content have led to layoffs at ESPN and struggles for Disney stock.

Disney responded with an acquisition, but not the kind to which we have grown accustomed to as the company has vacuumed up popular content-creators like Pixar, Marvel and “Star Wars” creator LucasFilm. Instead, the company bought a majority interest in BamTech, a spinoff from Major League Baseball that has become a leader in developing streaming services.

The first result of the marriage of a tech startup and legacy content provider is a newly updated ESPN app and the ESPN+ subscription option, which arrived nearly two years after it was originally announced. Disney hopes that consumers will pay $4.99 a month, or $50 for a year, to access a long list of games and other content to which it has the rights but is not showing on the channels for which cable subscribers pay roughly $8 or $9 a month through their cable bills.

Many of those games were already available, however, as part of a digital channel known as ESPN3 that will live on, according to the company. ESPN has long had an app, called WatchESPN, that offered live streams of all of its channels as well as many ESPN3 games it was not airing on its TV stations. ESPN+ bundles many of those streams it offered to subscribers in WatchESPN with other previously free services and some niche sports and original programming for a fee, and offers that service in the same app as streaming versions of ESPN channels available only to cable subscribers.

”Those subscribers are already paying more than $100 a year for ESPN content,” BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said in a telephone interview. “Now, they’re being asked to pay another $60 a year for the least compelling parts of that content.”

Can this robot make football safer?

ESPN pushed back against that characterization in an email to MarketWatch, saying “the majority of ESPN+ programming is new and additive to our existing networks.”

“We believe that the content offering is very compelling for avid sports fans as well as passionate fans of niche and underserved sports,” an ESPN spokeswoman said. “And at $4.99/month, we believe it’s an attractive offering compared to others currently in the marketplace for the audiences we are trying to reach and serve, while at the same time offering flexibility to subscribers.”

Specifically, ESPN+ will include college sports from smaller conferences such as the Big West and Ivy League, with most of the action from larger conferences, such as the Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference, still restricted to cable subscribers; live coverage of tennis and golf tournaments that include the ability to choose which feed to watch; professional soccer, including access to the Major League Soccer streaming service and certain English Football League, United Soccer League and UEFA Nations League games; boxing matches, through a deal with Top Rank Boxing; as well as cricket, rugby, Canadian Football League and other sports more popular outside the United States.

In addition, the full “30 for 30” documentary series, including Oscar-winner “O.J.: Made in America,” will be available on-demand at all times, and the latest addition to that catalogue — ”The Last Days of Knight,” about the downfall of former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight — will be an ESPN+ exclusive. Other original content is also planned for ESPN+ exclusively, including a new show called “Detail” helmed by former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant.

“We also will have a nightly hockey program throughout the playoffs, are developing a regular boxing program (more details to come) and are exploring shows for other segments as well (for example, MMA, cricket, etc),” the ESPN spokeswoman said.

Much of that content — a ton of small-college sports, tennis tournaments and many of the niche sports — was available to cable subscribers through WatchESPN, though some of it is new thanks to deals ESPN has announced in recent months, such as with MLS and Top Rank.

For an example of bundling of previously free content into the paid service, look at one other offering ESPN has pushed: Major League Baseball and National Hockey League games.

“For both MLB and NHL, ESPN+ will offer a game a day throughout the season — more than 180 games — as part of the $4.99,” the spokeswoman pointed out. “Those are games not available on our networks or other networks nationally. The only place those appear other than ESPN+ is if somebody buys the full MLB.TV or NHL.TV package.”

Those games, however, have been free to anyone for years. The MLB and NHL streaming services have long offered free games to non-subscribers — one a day for MLB, several a week for the NHL — in an attempt to draw in new customers to their streaming services. MLB has even broadcast its free daily games to other countries through Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +2.14% GOOG, +2.40% YouTube.

ESPN’s partnerships with MLB and the NHL also highlight Disney’s difficult path to offering direct-to-consumer services while attempting to support the lucrative cable bundle. In partnering with the two sports leagues, ESPN has the opportunity to make its new app something of a sports-focused “skinny bundle,” perhaps even including those leagues’ broadcast networks in addition to their streaming services. That potential would only grow if Disney’s acquisition of parts of 21st Century Fox FOXA, +1.67% is approved, as it will include broadcast rights to local broadcasts of many MLB and National Basketball Association games.

A platform of sports content from several sources, especially if offered without the need for cable subscriptions, could be a death knell for the cable bundle. Sports fans have largely held on to cable subscriptions because they are typically the only way to watch local sports teams — those broadcasts are typically blacked out on streaming services — as well as ESPN and other national sports networks.

At launch, though, ESPN's app is nowhere near that kind of offering. Current subscribers of the MLB and NHL streaming services won’t be able to watch that content through the ESPN app at launch. ESPN is offering subscriptions for those plans, but viewers must sign up through the ESPN app and pay Disney their subscription fee ($25 a month for MLB), similar to signing up for the services through a cable provider. Current subscribers will still have to visit those services’ dedicated apps instead of accessing all their paid sports content in ESPN’s app.

The new ESPN app and ESPN+ streaming service appear to be something of a test for Disney, which plans to launch similar offerings for non-sports content, as well as a warning to cable providers that Disney has a plan should they fail to keep the bundle alive. ESPN admitted that several features not available at launch are under consideration for the future, including pay-per-view events and bundling subscriptions with a similar effort on its website, ESPN Insider.

“We will continue to build the programming portfolio, actively, in the months and years ahead,” ESPN told MarketWatch.

That makes the service that launched Thursday unlikely to move the needle for Disney or consumers, as some investors may have hoped. ESPN is offering a 30-day free trial for consumers who sign up by April 18, and a seven-day free trial for other interested parties

”We’re going to see a niche-sports over-the-top service that allows Disney to learn more about the direct-to-consumer business,” BTIG’s Greenfield said. “If this was about getting tens of millions of subscribers, it would have everything.”

When Netflix separated its streaming and DVD-by-mail businesses, the company was not yet producing and distributing its own original content on the streaming service, instead offering mostly older shows and movies that could easily be found on cable or elsewhere. With ESPN+, Disney appears to have something similar to Netflix’s early attempt, with the same potential to be something much different down the line.","Well, there isn’t much different in what the Walt Disney Co.

On Monday, Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO) made a massive $130 billion bid for QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) have been two of the hottest stocks in the market in the past couple of years.

The semiconductor industry has exploded in size over the past two decades. Global semiconductor sales reached $340 billion in 2016, up from just $204 billion back in 2000. However, despite the massive growth of a number of semiconductor giants, there's still one unrivaled behemoth with a commanding global semiconductor market share lead: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC).

Even with a combined market cap of more than $200 billion, a combined Qualcomm-Broadcom would still only be the third largest semiconductor company in the world, according to Statista.

The chart below shows the top global semiconductor companies by market share, and Intel’s 15.9 percent share is more than triple every other company except for Samsung’s 11.8 percent share. Qualcomm and Broadcom would combine for 8.4 percent market share.

That relatively modest market share is good news for Qualcomm investors hoping the deal makes it past antitrust regulators. Even after the $70 per-share bid price was announced, Qualcomm’s shares are trading at around $63 per share. The roughly 10 percent discount to the buyout price suggests there's meaningful skepticism that the deal will go through in a timely manner.

Qualcomm management has indicated it plans to oppose the buyout and believes the bid price doesn’t reflect the full value of the company.

55,"Feb 17, 2018",MarketWatch,Why ‘Black Panther’ is the most important blockbuster in years,"Even before making its theatrical debut this Friday, “Black Panther” has already been called one of the most successful comic-book films of its time, culturally and financially.

The film, directed by Ryan Coogler — the first African American filmmaker to helm a Marvel film in 10 years, after 17 movies — follows T’Challa, who is the Black Panther, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, the most technologically advanced country in the Marvel universe. Resource-rich Wakanda sits on the largest repository of vibranium (the metal used to forge Captain America's shield), has remained untouched by colonialism.

“Black Panther” assembles a predominantly black cast of some of Hollywood’s most bankable stars in the first major film centered around a black superhero since 2008’s “Hancock,” starring Will Smith, and before that, the “Blade” trilogy, which first starred Wesley Snipes as the Marvel vampire in 1998.

Coogler’s movie is now expected to open at between $190 million and $210 million in its first weekend, surpassing initial estimates. Online ticket retailer Fandango says advance ticket sales for “Black Panther” have outsold all other superhero films in the company’s history.

More than what the superhero film could mean for Marvel and parent company Walt Disney Co. DIS, +4.04% , “Black Panther” will almost without a doubt become the highest-grossing film from a black director, and it looks poised to become the most commercially successful superhero blockbuster in history. Disney has made its bet on the film, investing about $200 million in it, and another $150 million to market it, according to Variety.

“Black Panther” is a big deal, and its prominence is important.

Though it’s been in development for years, “Black Panther” is being thrust into a Hollywood landscape still reeling from the #OscarsSoWhite controversies in 2015 and 2016.

“It is important because of the growing need to challenge the misperceptions of Hollywood that says major studio films featuring people of color won’t be successful at the level necessary to make a profit and attract wide audiences,” said entertainment lawyer Darrell Miller, who represents one of “Black Panther’s” stars, Angela Bassett.

“Black Panther” isn’t the first black superhero film ever — aside from “Hancock” and “Blade,” there has been “The Meteor Man” and “Blankman” — and the Black Panther character isn’t the only African superhero. Thanks to Halle Berry’s portrayal in the “X-Men” films, Storm may have been more well-known than the Wakandan King.

But “Black Panther” is entering into the cultural consciousness at a significant moment in time. The sitting U.S. president has referred to African nations as “shitholes,” alt-right groups have attempted to sabotage “Black Panther” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” through the newfound influence of Rotten Tomatoes, persons of color are still fighting for significant representation in Hollywood, and the Black Lives Matter movement has reinvigorated conversations around systemic racism.

“I teach my students to see a film in the context of the times,” said Sheril Antonio, an associate dean and professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. “These are not normal times that we are in — artistically, politically, socially, economically, and in terms of the global multicultural stance. There’s an extreme sense of divided perspective on race.”

“The post-racial, post-whatever era was exposed not to be past at all, but very much present… most people will say we went back to a 1950s attitude,” Antonio said.

Black film, black filmmakers and people of color have been through significant moments before.

In 1971, in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released “Shaft,” produced on a budget of $500,000. The film grossed $13 million, helping MGM stave off bankruptcy while also serving as the catalyst for the blaxploitation subgenre that spawned more than a decade of films dedicated solely to black audiences.

“Shaft” was crucial in African-Americans’ advancement in Hollywood.

“It was the rocket out of an era into mainstream white America. It signaled a cultural shift,” Antonio said.

Then in the late ’80s and early ’90s, “Do the Right Thing,” “Boyz in the Hood” and “Malcolm X” — along with filmmakers such as Spike Lee, John Singleton, Mario Van Peebles, Ernest Dickerson and Julie Dash — helped usher in a new era of potent and socially conscious black film.

“Black Panther” now follows a recent string of commercially and critically successful films which have sought to tell black stories, or bring black faces to the forefront.

“Girls Trip,” Universal Pictures’s CMCSA, +2.29% comedy following four friends travelling to the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans in order to reconnect, not only launched Tiffany Haddish to stardom, but became a critical and box-office darling. “Girls Trip” was the first comedy of 2017 to reach $100 million at the box office, after a string of poor-performing films from a genre Hollywood has come to rely on. The film, made for $19 million, earned $115.2 million and was the top-grossing comedy of the year.

“Hidden Figures” brought the stories of three black female NASA scientists, forgotten by history, to the big screen. It garnered 20th Century Fox FOXA, +1.67% three Oscar nominations, including best picture, earned $236 million worldwide and showed a generation of young black girls they too can dream for the stars. “Moonlight” drove the cultural conversation, eventually winning best picture at the Oscars.

This year, “Get Out” has hopes of nabbing the same honor, which wouldn’t have been a possibility five years ago. Director Jordan Peele become only the third filmmaker to receive directing, writing and best picture nominations for a directorial debut. The film’s shoestring budget of $4.5 million and $255 million worldwide gross made it one of 2017’s most-profitable movies.

See:When are the 2018 Oscars?

The social thriller, delivering commentary on systemic racism in a dark take on “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” received its four Oscar nominations almost a full year after its release in theaters — a testament to its impact.

The success of these films, and those to come after them, is important. Hollywood immediately becomes interested in making more movies that speak to that audience, Miller said, and in turn studios are more willing to spend significant production and marketing dollars on tentpole films focusing on people of color.

“We need allies,” Henderson said. “We can’t do this alone, and justice can’t be reached with just black people in power.”

The Dora Milaje in Marvel Comics are an elite group of female bodyguards and Wakandan special forces. Marvel Studios

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were, after all, the stewards of Black Panther’s creation in 1966.

“Black Panther” shows a commitment by a major studio to producing films that speak to the 5.6 million African American moviegoers that were recorded going to the theater in 2016 — the latest data from the National Association of Theater Owners. The number of African American moviegoers has increased each year for the last few years, and while African Americans make up 12% of the population, they accounted for 14% of ticket movie ticket sales in 2016.

“Let us not forget the power of audiences,” Antonio said. “[But] we put a lot of pressure on this one film to ‘save’ us, and that’s not fair. We’re guessing based on the energy afoot in this moment whether or not this will be a timeless, significant work of art.”

“It’s unfair, but that is culture, that is the nature of art,” she said. “Art isn’t necessarily fair. But I think it is a worthy question to ask and an important lesson and it shows the importance of not just talking about a film when it comes out, but following it through its life.”

Heading into its release, “Black Panther” has everything going for it. The film has a 98% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, and the buzz that has surrounded the film leading up to this weekend has been astonishing.

When casting details began trickling out in May 2016, the hashtag #BlackPantherSoLit began trending on Twitter. Schools and organizations have raised money in order to take young black kids to see the movie for free. And after pictures of the film’s premiere appeared online, discussions of what to wear to the movie’s opening weekend — kente cloth, dashikis and other traditional African garb — became a hot topic.

It’s hard to imagine “Black Panther” not being a hit. It’s hard, in the fever pitch leading up to its release, to imagine the film won’t leave a lasting impression on audiences who see it, and on the industry that can greenlight more films like it.

“When we talk about the end goal, it’s as simple as this: I want to be present in telling my own story,” Henderson said. “Black people have historically been excluded from those spaces, from the writers room, in front of and behind the camera. It’s hard to define an endpoint, but our goal is equality.”","Online ticket retailer Fandango says advance ticket sales for “Black Panther” have outsold all other superhero films in the company’s history.

On the heels of a dozen tech firms already questionably distant from the digital ledger business, Long Island Iced Tea Corp (NASDAQ: LTEA) is embracing blockchain.

The specialty beverage producer announced Thursday its intended shift into the trending theme and preparatory — if not premature — rebranding to the less poetic “Long Blockchain Corp.”

It has neither relevant assets nor agreements to acquire assets meriting the new label, but that doesn't matter. The stock ran up more 300 percent anyway.

Others, like furniture firm Nova Lifestyle Inc (NASDAQ: NVFY), declared new blockchain segments ostensibly irrelevant to their core. Still others — “Long Blockchain Corp.” — lacked both natural association with blockchain technology and existing assets to back a publicized transition.

But those details proved inconsequential. The market rewarded mere allusions to blockchain.

The phenomenon has inspired a proliferation of blockchain announcements from opportunistic firms.

“It’s almost like flat-out trying to manipulate your price higher, unless they’ve really got the real stuff and they’re really changing their whole business model, but I think some of these are just coming out with press releases to take advantage of the mania and pump their prices up, and I think they’re probably dumping stock,” Dennis Dick, co-host of Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep and proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC, said.

Suspicion aside, the strategy’s been effective, and the likes of Long Island have gotten the value boost they’d hoped for.

Value investors missed out as their “cheap” stocks lagged growth miserably – by as many as 16 percentage points depending on the yardstick. But that’s going to change in 2018. It’s shaping up to be the year Buffett’s minions may finally rejoice. “Value will have its day in the sun,” predicts John Buckingham, a veteran value investor and chief investment officer at AFAM Capital Asset Management.

Being in value means you have a tailwind – sooner or later.

Here are 10 value stocks to buy for “the year of value”: Data is as of Jan. 11, 2017. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent quarterly payout and dividing by the share price.

Gilead Sciences Dividend yield: 2.6%

2.6% Gilead Sciences (GILD, $79.06) is a good example of how too much success can be bad for a biotech company. Unlike many drugs, Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi and Harvoni effectively cure patients with hepatitis C so they don’t have to keep dosing. The problem: Once Gilead has treated enough hep C patients, there are fewer left to take the drugs. This dynamic, plus competition from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK), means Gilead’s hep C therapy revenue growth has vanished. The hep C “problem” combined with investor concerns about crackdowns on drug pricing helps explain why this once hot growth name has turned into a favorite value stock of Albert Meyer, who runs Bastiat Capital. Meyer is worth listening to because he trounces the S&P 500. His accounts are up 176.5% since April 2006 inception compared to 104% for the S&P 500. What might turn things around for Gilead, which trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.6? The company recently purchased a pioneering cancer treatment company called Kite Pharma. Its CAR T-cell genetic engineering therapy is poised for takeoff. Gilead has a strong portfolio of HIV therapies, and it is launching more. It also has a pipeline of immunology and liver disease drugs. Meanwhile, despite its growth slowdown, Gilead still is incredibly profitable, Meyer says. And it pays investors a dividend yield of 2.6% while they wait for the biotech company to turn around.

IBM Dividend yield: 3.7%

3.7% International Business Machines (IBM, $164.20) has the blues. The stock has gone virtually nowhere in the past year, in a strong market. “It is probably the most hated stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average other than General Electric,” says Steven Check, a value investor at Check Capital Management, which has $1.5 billion under management. IBM has a forward price earnings ratio of less than 12, compared to 23 for Microsoft (MSFT). Of course, hated names often are the ones most loved by value investors. IBM is a great example. Check counts it among his holdings in managed accounts and at his Blue Chip Investor Fund (BCIFX), which has outperformed its category by 2 percentage points a year, annualized, over the past three years. AFAM’s Buckingham also likes Big Blue. IBM may be in old-school mainframe computers. But that’s not so bad. They still play a big role inside many companies because they’re reliable and secure. IBM recently rolled out a new version, the z14, and sales are picking up. IBM’s core mainframe business serves as a source of stability and funding for its “strategic Imperatives,” like analytics and cloud computing. “It isn’t going to take too much in the way of good news for this stock to finally react,” Check says. A shift in investor sentiment could work wonders. Check points out that Microsoft shares have more than doubled in the past three years, even though earnings have barely budged from 2013-14 levels – thanks to a sentiment shift alone. Meanwhile, because of IBM’s core strengths, the downside is limited. “IBM is not going away,” Check says. “Limit the downside, and the upside will take care of itself, eventually.”

Goldman Sachs Dividend yield: 1.2% Coming out of the financial crisis when everyone hated Wall Street, Goldman Sachs (GS, $255.13) was described as a “great vampire squid ... relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money” by Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi. The moniker stuck. But it turns out Goldman was more of a vampire plankton. While colorfully described, the bank’s supposedly domineering presence hasn’t helped much. Goldman’s stock is up only 62% since Rolling Stone introduced the squid metaphor in early April 2010, compared to 169% gains for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) exchange-traded fund (both include dividends). This reminds us that the media regularly serve as a source of great contrarian signals. Beyond that lesson, Goldman confirms that quality companies lagging the markets by huge amounts often are targets of value investors. Goldman’s weakness is one reason Meyer, at Bastiat Capital, owns the bank for clients. The stock trades well below the market multiple. It has a forward price earnings ratio of 12, Meyer says. What could go right? Goldman should benefit from ongoing deregulation in the U.S. and strong, synchronized global growth. Goldman gets about 40% of its revenue from abroad. It has been cutting costs and buying back stock. Meanwhile, it can repatriate more than $25 billion, which it could use to support more share buybacks or a dividend hike, Meyer says.

General Electric Dividend yield: 2.5% Fabled General Electric (GE, $19.02) has a reputation as a top management training ground that spawns great leaders. They go on to guide other companies to greatness once it’s clear they aren’t getting the CEO slot at GE. But something went wrong with Jeffrey Immelt, a General Electric alum who won the CEO job in 2000. Either he got dealt a bad hand by being on the job during the financial crisis. Or he simply tried to do too much. Whatever the reason, his tenure – which ended in October 2017 – was a disaster. The stock is lower than it was when he took the helm. And it is down 40% in the past year. But there’s a silver lining to the story: These kinds of declines are a value investor’s dream. Many have stepped in to buy the stock amid the current weakness. “Long term, it is going to be a decent investment,” says Bob Bacarella, co-manager of Monetta Young Investor Fund (MYIFX). New CEO John Flannery, who took over last summer, is managing a restructuring, including selling off non-core assets and cutting costs. He has been buying GE stock, a bullish sign. A big positive for investors is that about 70% of General Electric’s sales come from business where the company dominates the market, meaning aviation, power and healthcare, points out George Putnam, who recently suggested the stock in his Turnaround Letter. “I think GE has good long-term fundamentals, and the new CEO is taking the right steps to clean house and set the stage for the stock to do well,” he says.

Alaska Air Group Dividend yield: 1.7% Unlike competitors Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) which are soaring near 52-week highs, shares of Alaska Air Group (ALK, $74.81) are flying low – at least relative to where they were last winter. The stock is down 20% over the past 52 weeks. What’s the problem? “It’s in the penalty box because of the Virgin America acquisition,” says AFAM’s Buckingham, who also manages the Al Frank Fund (VALUX). Alaska Air picked up the competitor in late 2016. Some analysts question whether it makes sense to kill off the Virgin brand, which Alaska Air plans to do in late 2019 to avoid licensing fees. But the merger gives Alaska Air greater access to the California market and valuable East Coast airport gates. “We think the merger will be a positive,” Buckingham says. “It’s one of the best-run airlines, and it has great routes. The combination of low fares and a top-level customer experience will continue to be the recipe for Alaska Air’s long-term success.” An added bonus: Alaska Air pays a tax rate in the mid-30% range. So it will get a big boost from tax reform, which lowers the corporate rate to 21%. Alaska Airlines trades for a little more than 11 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 12.6, Buckingham says.

Twenty-First Century Fox Dividend yield: 1.0% Despite the big gains in the shares of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA, $36.20) since Walt Disney (DIS) announced plans to purchase its entertainment assets in December, the media giant still looks undervalued, maintains HighMark’s Lowenstein. In the deal, Disney will get 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox’s television studios, Fox Sports, regional U.S. sports networks, international cable networks and Fox’s 30% stake in Hulu, the online TV platform. FOXA shareholders will get about 25% of the new Disney. And they will be left with a collection of Fox broadcast assets, like its news channels. “The remaining company is an interesting collection of unique assets that look mispriced,” Lowenstein says. The broadcast assets are probably worth $9 to $12 per share. But the implied valuation of these assets in the deal – basically Twenty-First Century Fox’s market cap minus the value of Disney shares they will get – is $4.50 a share. “It looks like a mispriced asset,” Lowenstein says. “It looks like it is trading at 50 cents on the dollar.” The risk here is that the Disney-Fox deal fails to go through. But Lowenstein thinks it will.

Hanesbrands Dividend yield: 2.8% People are funny about their underwear. They don’t like to change them – the brand, that is. Once they find a brand that fits and feels right, they tend to stick with it. That loyalty works in favor of Hanesbrands (HBI, $22.34). It also should help investors who take advantage of the current weakness in Hanesbrands stock to establish positions. HBI shares have been weak for reasons that won’t last forever. Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have been reducing inventory, which slowed sales growth at Hanesbrands, says Check, whose Check Capital Management owns the stock. “That has probably played itself out by now,” he says. Then there’s the shift in retails sales to online venues like Amazon.com (AMZN). That’s not really a problem for Hanesbrands, though. Thanks to the loyalty consumers have to the Hanes, Champion and Maidenform brands, the company can just sell skivvies, bras and socks on Amazon. “There is nothing wrong with the brand or market share, and the stock trades at a P/E of around 10,” Check says. “The slight sales growth decline spooked everyone.” Behind the scenes, the company has a huge advantage. Hanesbrands owns a big global supply chain with plants in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. This means its costs are 15%-20% below those of competitors.

Liberty Interactive Dividend yield: N/A

N/A Liberty Interactive (QVCA, $26.65) is media mogul John Malone’s tracking stock for the QVC and HSN home shopping networks. (Tracking stocks represent the value of an underlying business without giving investors a claim on any of the assets.) In a pricey stock market, Liberty Interactive looks cheap because it has a very high free cash flow yield, HighMark’s Lowenstein says. Free cash flow yield is free cash flow, or operating cash flow, divided by market cap. So the lower market cap is relative to operating cash flow, the cheaper the stock. QVCA trades for about a 10% free cash flow yield, compared to 4.5% for the S&P 500. Why is the company trading so cheap? “It is considered a dinosaur business in terminal decline,” Lowenstein says. “But we think it’s a quality business with a loyal customer base.” He sees three catalysts. First, QVC recently merged with its biggest competitor, HSN, so there should be cost savings. Next, the company is converting the tracking shares into normal shares, which should reduce the natural discount that tracking stocks carry. Finally, Liberty has been holding off on stock buybacks because of the HSN transaction. But the deal closed in December, so buybacks should resume. “In a stock market that is very expensive, this is a cheap stock with catalysts,” Lowenstein says.

Schnitzer Steel Industries Dividend yield: 2% No roundup of value stocks for 2018 would be complete without a few small-cap names. Not only do they suffer from the 2017 value curse, they’ve been held back by a market cap headwind. Small-cap stocks have been lagging, too. These challenges could fade for several reasons. Small-cap companies pay higher taxes – in part because they can’t afford the army of tax lawyers funded by big companies, and in part because they generate more of their revenues domestically. So they will benefit more from the corporate tax cuts. Also, since many large caps appear fully valued, investors may start hunting among smaller names for cheaper stocks. Finally, small-cap companies tend to be leaner and meaner. This means they benefit more from inflation, since more of any price increases fall to the bottom line. All these trends may help Schnitzer Steel Industries (SCHN, $38.70), a leader in scrap metal dealing. Schnitzer collects, processes and sells huge amounts of metal, primarily steel. The company cut costs and paid down debt during a 2014-16 steel sector slump, so now that the sector is recovering, Schnitzer stands to benefit. “The end markets have entered into fairly robust recovery,” says Evans, at the Heartland Value Plus Fund, which owns this stock. He thinks annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization could return to $200 million to $250 million, from recent levels of $150 million. If so, that could send Schnitzer Steel’s stock up to $50 from the high $30s, based on historical valuation metrics.","Value investors missed out as their “cheap” stocks lagged growth miserably – by as many as 16 percentage points depending on the yardstick.

59,"Mar 15, 2018",Nasdaq,Does Amazon Profit From Its Original TV Shows & Movies?,"In news that might spark even more fear in the film and television industry, documents show that Amazon's AMZN original shows and movies have helped the internet and e-commerce power further bolster its already massive customer base.

Prime Originals

Amazon has spent millions of dollars to pump out a slew of new streaming television series and movies over the last few years. Most investors likely viewed this move as way to diversify and expand its reach in order to one day profit on a quickly-changing entertainment industry. Yet these investments, which include shows such as The Man in the High Castle and Sneaky Pete , have already driven millions of customers to its lucrative Prime shopping service.

The company's top television shows reportedly enticed more than 5 million people worldwide to become Amazon Prime shoppers by early 2017, based on internal documents reviewed by Reuters. These same documents also show that the company reached about 26 million people in the U.S. across all Prime video content-which also features non-original programming.

The Man in the High Castle cost about $72 million in total and drew 1.15 million new subscribers at an average cost of $63 per customer, based on numbers crunched by Reuters.

What's the Big Idea?

Jeff Bezos' first foray into the movie industry began in November 2010 when the company launched Amazon Studios. At the time, the idea was to develop movies with a more grassroots approach. Amazon pledged to offer $2.7 million to filmmakers and writers through a series of monthly and annual awards, of which a few movie and TV projects would begin to be developed-with the help of Warner Bros. TWX -in early 2012.

""We hope that Amazon Studios will help filmmakers experiment and collaborate and we look forward to developing hit movies,"" said in a statement .

But Amazon went from offering less than $3 million in total to hopeful movie makers to shelling out $250 million on a new The Lord of the Rings series in just eight years.

Bezos has made original content one of Amazon's most public endeavors, and Amazon is expected to spend roughly $5 billion on new original programming this year alone. Yet this spend would mark just a drop in the bucket for a company that is projected to pull in $234.22 billion in revenues in 2018.

And in this race towards streaming dominance, $5 billion isn't even that much. Rival Netflix NFLX plans to spend $8 billion on content in 2018, while Disney DIS is just getting started.

Disney has already announced a new Star Wars series, and looks set to sell its own over-the-top streaming platform by late 2019. The media powerhouse could pose even more of a threat if its proposed deal with 21 st Century Fox (FOXA) is approved.

Bottom Line

Amazon still makes most of its profit from its web hosting and cloud computing business, which some of its Prime shoppers don't even know exist. But investors should be happy to see that Amazon is spending money in the TV and movie business right as streaming content truly starts to change the entire media landscape.

The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All

Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

60,"Feb 19, 2018",MarketWatch,New Hulu drama ‘The Looming Tower’ ‘breaks new ground’ examining causes of 9/11,"From “United 93” to “Zero Dark Thirty”, films and TV series about the 9/11 attacks haven’t exactly been uncommon.

But the makers of Hulu’s new TV limited mini-series “The Looming Tower”, focusing on the causes and consequences of 9/11 and examining the lives of prominent players in the tragedy, are claiming their drama brings a fresh approach to the subject.

Based on Lawrence Wright’s 2006 Pulitzer-winning book of the same name, “The Looming Tower” features many of the people profiled in the book including John O’Neill, an FBI agent, who left the organization to become head of security at the World Trade Center- played by Jeff Daniels-, White House counter-terrorism chief Richard Clarke (Michael Stuhlbarg) and former CIA Director George Tenet (portrayed by Alec Baldwin).

Central to the drama is the growing presence of Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda and the dysfunctional relationship between the FBI and the CIA, which many believe reduced the likelihood of 9/11 being prevented.

“The Looming Tower” takes an edgier look at 9/11 compared with other depictions of the tragedy such as Oliver Stone’s 2006 movie “World Trade Center.” While Hulu itself is a joint venture of Walt Disney Co. DIS, +4.04% , Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.29% , 21st Century Fox Inc. FOXA, +1.67% and Time Warner Inc US:TWX, the CIA and FBI refused to co-operate with the show’s creative team.

But Hulu is hoping that “The Looming Tower” chimes with the public consciousness the same way that its Emmy-winning adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale” has done.

“I don’t think that the run-up to 9-11 has ever been treated as fully or as carefully or as seriously as we treat it in “The Looming Tower,” said Oscar-winning executive producer Alex Gibney, who also directed two episodes, at the show’s premiere at Manhattan’s Paris Theater.

“In its own way, this breaks new ground,” Gibney added. “Obviously we’ve had the 9/11 Commission Report but “The Looming Tower” really focuses on the characters themselves and how it happened.”

Among the characters is Richard Clarke played by Stuhlbarg, who got on much better with President Clinton than he did with his White House successor George W. Bush. Clarke left the Bush administration in 2003.

“I think it’s a pretty thorough investigation of what was going on in the world at that time,” Stuhlbarg said of “The Looming Tower.” “Getting to look back at our lives in this way will be interesting for all of us to see where we are, where we’ve come from and what we need to do to continue to try and make our country and the world a safer place.”

Stuhlbarg, who can currently be seen in award season movies “The Post”, “Call Me By Your Name” and “The Shape of Water”, seems to admire the character he plays. “Richard Clarke is a real American patriot on so many levels,” he said, “and he worked so hard to try to keep us safe during this time. I don’t think there’s much more he could have done.”

Actor Peter Sarsgaard, who plays fictional composite CIA Agent Martin Schmidt who locks horns with the FBI, was in no mood at the premiere to speak highly of the US government. Asked what he learned from the series, Sarsgaard replied, “That al Qaeda’s first goal had nothing to do with us. It was to reform the Middle East and make it more consistent with the values that they believed [were enshrined] in Sharia Law.”

“The reason it became about us [America] was because of our involvement in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel. It wasn’t because of our pornography or capitalism or anything like that.”

How did the U.S. become so involved into the Middle East? “It all has to do with oil and money,” Sarsgaard answered. “It’s depressing. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people have died- for what? None of it is any better. Al Qaeda is bigger today than it was at the time of 9/11. The idea that ISIS, reduced in size and smashed, is going to just walk away is a pipe dream.”

.Gibney says “The Looming Tower” possesses political relevance for today’s world. “Things did change after 9/11,” he said.

“But at this present time, when congress is squabbling so badly, you see the disastrous effect of what happened when our government agencies were not working together to solve practical problems. They were working against each other and that had catastrophic consequences.”

At the heart of “The Looming Tower” is the relationship between Muslim-American agent Ali Soufan (played by Tahar Rahim) and John O’Neill (who was previously played by Harvey Keitel in a controversial ABC 2006 mini-series “The Path to 9/11: The Man Who Warned America.”)

“The Looming Tower” explores how O’Neill’s frustrations with tackling terrorism led him to take a job as head of security at the World Trade Center less than a month before the 9/11 attacks. It also depicts his extravagant spending habits.

“There were economic pressures,” said the show’s writer and executive producer Adam Rapp. “You don’t really make much money working for the government and when he was pushed out and forced out to retire, he wanted to get his finances right. We dramatize that later in the season where it charts how he came to take the job for Larry Silverstein [leaseholder of the World Trade Center] at the Twin Towers.”

“That the guy who might have been closest to Bin Laden’s next move was pushed out of the FBI, took a job at the World Trade Center and then the building fell on him when he was going to the other one to try and help somebody is a terrible irony and a brutal piece of poetry. You couldn’t put that in a script and have someone believe it.”

CIA agent Martin Schmidt (Peter Saarsgard) in ‘The Looming Tower’ JoJo Whilden/Hulu

Dan Futterman, the showrunner and executive producer, said: “O’Neill was having a hard time with the FBI. He was sloppy professionally and sloppy personally and he was having a hard time retaining his job. On the government salary that he was earning he liked to live large- he liked to buy everybody drinks, he liked to travel and dress extremely well and he had a lot of debts to pay off.”

“Once he was out, he needed to find a job that was going to pay well so he went to work at the World Trade Center. He had several girlfriends, at least two of them thought they were engaged to him. He also had a wife and children in New Jersey.”

“The Looming Tower” also explores the relationship between the US Government and the CIA and Saudi Arabia power brokers and the financial fronts that Al-Qaeda used in New York City, and London to hide their assets.

Research for “The Looming Tower” actors varied. Michael Stuhlbarg met with his character Richard Clarke while Wrenn Schmidt, who plays CIA analyst Diane Priest, said: “I did a lot of research starting out by listening to a lot of Missy Elliott before my audition. That is not a joke- I needed to get out of my head and into the room. But then I also met with a former CIA field agent.”

CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS) has confirmed it is in talks with Viacom, Inc. (VIA, VIAB) to potentially reunite the two companies after they spit from each other back in 2006. The companies say they formed a joint exploratory committee to discuss a merger.

“There can be no assurance that this process will result in a transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur,” the companies say in a statement, adding that neither would comment further on a deal until it is finalized.

A combined CBS-Viacom would be a force to be reckoned with in the media landscape, joining CBS’s television networks and CBS All Access streaming service with Viacom’s cable TV channels and movie studio.

A deal would also continue the theme of blockbuster mergers in the media market. In March, AT&T (T) must defend its potential $85.4 billion union with Time Warner (TWX) in court after the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the deal on antitrust grounds.

Media companies hoping to compete with the wildly successful over-the-top streaming model of Netflix (NFLX) are aggressively looking to acquire more content. AT&T wants the Time Warner cable assets for its DirecTV Now streaming service. Walt Disney Co. (DIS) recently acquired cable TV and movie assets from Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) ahead of the planned 2019 launch of a Disney streaming service.

BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield says CBS is taking the same approach to try to give its CBS All Access, which currently costs $5.99 per month, a shot in the arm.

“The problem with CBS All Access is the content is limited. CBS simply does not have enough content or enough scale” Greenfield says. “All of the content studios inside of Viacom would be a meaningful addition.”

Shari Redstone, daughter of media mogul Sumner Redstone, is reportedly orchestrating the merger talks between CBS and Viacom. The Redstone family controls both CBS and Viacom via investments through privately held National Amusements.

CBS said last year that it expected CBS All Access to reach 4 million subscribers by the end of 2017. Investors will likely get an update on All Access as well as more information on the Viacom merger talks when CBS reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 15.

63,"Jul 29, 2017",Benzinga,Expert: Predicted 37% Pop In TV Retransmission Fees A 'Natural Righting Of The Ship',"Telecom stocks started to release earnings this week with AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA), and many investors are on the watch for changes to retransmission fees.

The charges have been trending upward as broadcasters demand more and more from cable operators like Comcast and multichannel video programming distributors like AT&T to retransmit their channel signals.

Having risen from $215 million in 2006 to nearly $8 billion in 2016, fees are projected to rest around $12.8 billion by 2023, according to Kagan research.

If Kagan’s estimates are as conservative as they’ve been before, figures could be even higher. In 2013, the firm projected fees would hit $6.05 billion within five years. It only took one.

Who Cares?

Some experts don’t consider the rise particularly startling.

“These numbers make a lot of sense, frankly,” Dan Kurnos, managing director of internet and media equity research at The Benchmark Company, told Benzinga. “This rise of retrans to me is a natural righting of the ship or a natural balancing. The guys that are responsible for the most viewership in the bundle are finally starting to get paid for it.”

The fees have been negotiated since the mid-2000s as a delayed result of federal retransmission consent law passed in 1992. At that time, cable owners and MVPDs were first required to secure broadcaster permission to carry and resell station programming within their packages.

“The argument for the broadcasters has always been that the total number of viewers they bring to the table based on eyeballs alone is a fraction of what they are getting paid by the networks,” Kurnos said.

Cable owners can reject the terms proposed by broadcasters, but they risk not being able to air certain channels and deliver content. If they accept and pass the cost of fees on to subscribers, they forfeit pricing leverage.

In response to an uptick in retrans fees beginning in 2011, distributors are retaliating with reverse comp fees, which stations pay their networks for programming.

Failed negotiations have resulted in a number of channel blackouts for consumers.

Significance of Retrans

Retrans now accounts for about 40 percent of major companies’ revenue streams, Kurnos said.

For Nexstar Media Group Inc (NASDAQ: NXST), it accounted for more than 38 percent of its revenue in 2016 after having contributed about 4.5 percent in 2008. Similarly, E.W. Scripps Co (NYSE: SSP) saw a pop from 9.6 percent in 2016 to nearly 30 percent in 2013.

CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS) earned a full $1 billion in 2016, and it set a goal of bringing in $2.5 billion in retransmission licensing by 2020.

Fellow broadcasters include TV networks and affiliate station owners, such as Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)’s ABC, Comcast’s NBC, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (NASDAQ: FOXA)’s FOX, Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAB), Tribune Media Co (NYSE: TRCO), Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (NASDAQ: SBGI), Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE: GTN), News Corp (NASDAQ: NWSA), Media General, Inc. (NYSE: MEG), Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNI), Meredith Corporation (NYSE: MDP) and Tegna Inc (NYSE: TGNA).

These companies offer news programs, late night shows, dramas and comedies.

While the aforementioned firms profit from the fees, cable and satellite companies like DISH Network Corp (NASDAQ: DISH), Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX), Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE: CVC), WideOpenWest Inc (NYSE: WOW), Cable One Inc (NYSE: CABO) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) take hits.

How Investors React

Retrans fees have become critical to many investment strategies as advertising ostensibly declines, Kurnos said.

“Since it’s such a large portion of revenue and it’s also a 50-plus percent margin business, because the amount they have to pay in network compensation or reverse retrans, that kind of dictates what's going on in the marketplace,” he added.

Kurnos considers retransmission fees central to the stories of MVPDs and over-the-top services, which are going around broadcasters, but even more so telecommunications firms.

“I think the real question is what happens to telco guys, the AT&Ts of the world, because which side of the spectrum do they fall on?” Kurnos said. “Do they push skinny bundles like Dish or Sling, or if the MVPDs go back to a tiered pricing model, how does that look in the grand scheme of things?”

Then there’s advertising and ambiguity surrounding ad agency reactions.

“Do we go more programmatic? Does more get placed national?” Kurnos said, noting McDonald’s recent pull from local spots. “What happens to the internet advertisers, and how does this all play out on mobile?”

But the rising fees won’t necessarily affect streaming services.

“It depends on whether or not the over-the-top services are ancillary or if they are cord-cutting, cord-shaving,” Kurnos said. “A lot has been made about the rise of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and streaming solutions, and there’s been a whole bunch of talk about cord-cutting, and yet there’s still 100 million pay TV households, Netflix is in over 50 percent of households in the U.S., and the skinny bundles haven’t really taken off either, so until you get a dramatic shift where internet is the predominant source of distribution for the marketplace, I don’t think you’re going to see massive change in viewership habits.”

64,"Feb 8, 2018",TheStreet,Disney Has Big Strengths -- and Weaknesses -- as it Takes on Netflix and Amazon,"The media giant's unique intellectual property and sports rights provide a path to success. But Netflix and Amazon's scale advantages are nothing to gloss over.

Following the disclosures made during Tuesday's earnings call, there's more clarity than ever regarding how Disney (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report plans to contend with a digital video market in which Netflix (NFLX) - Get Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Report and Amazon.com (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report loom large and cord-cutting continues pressuring its lucrative pay-TV affiliate fee business.

The disclosures suggest Disney is being pretty thoughtful about how it plans to support, price and segment its various streaming offerings. They also suggest that, thoughtful or not, Disney's decision-making is constrained by the big head-starts Netflix and Amazon possess, as well as by its need to avoid cannibalizing giant sports affiliate fee revenue streams.

On the call, CEO Bob Iger disclosed an upcoming ESPN streaming service will launch this spring, be known as ESPN Plus and cost $4.99 per month. He reiterated the service will stream MLB, NHL, MLS and college games (among other things), albeit no NFL or NBA games, and added that it will also provide access to the ESPN Films library.

ESPN Plus, along with the WatchESPN service provided to pay-TV subs, will be accessible through a ""completely re-conceived and redesigned ESPN app."" Iger also said Disney plans to ""invest further in [ESPN Plus], adding more live games and [producing] sports programming, along with even greater personalization in the years ahead.""

Regarding the upcoming Disney-branded streaming service (first disclosed last August), Iger reiterated the service will launch in late 2019, and will -- once a deal with Netflix runs out at decade's end -- be the exclusive streaming home of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars films. He also stated the service, already promised to initially be cheaper than Netflix, will contain ""a few"" different Star Wars original series, along with a High School Musical series and other originals relying on Disney's IP.

Notably, Iger also indicated that Disney doesn't plan to have its streaming service match Netflix's content spending, arguing that the company's brands and IP make doing so unnecessary. ""[W]hen you go to market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas...that will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands.""

That's the glass-half-full view of Disney's strategy. The glass-half-empty view: Netflix's giant head-start makes it impossible for Disney to justify matching Netflix's original content spend, and perhaps also not Amazon's. Netflix ended 2017 with 117.6 million streaming subs, and is forecast on average by analysts to end 2019 with 165.6 million. Such torrid subscriber growth has made the company comfortable setting a 2018 content budget of $7.5 billion to $8 billion (up from 2017's $6 billion), and to promise further spending hikes for 2019 and 2020.

Amazon doesn't break out how much its spends on content for its Prime Video services, which come bundled with Amazon Prime subscriptions. But JPMorgan estimated last year Amazon would spend $4.9 billion on content in 2017. And with Prime's global subscriber base believed to be above 70 million and still growing rapidly, Jeff Bezos' company has plenty of incentives to keep investing heavily in Prime Video.

In addition to enabling giant content budgets, Netflix and Amazon's scale provides them with a ton of viewing data they can use to personalize their services and inform future content-financing decisions. It also gives them more flexibility to finance original shows and movies aimed at international markets or niche audiences.

The ""tentpole"" films puts out by Disney's studios will certainly serve to keep content costs down for the upcoming Disney service. But the fact that Disney has no plans to get rid of the traditional theater release window for its films will affect the popularity of its service a bit. Netflix, by contrast, is comfortable making its original films immediately available on its service.

Disney's wish to protect Hulu's existing business, as well as the ""family-friendly"" nature of the Disney brand, also acts as a constraint for the upcoming Disney service. Though the company plans for the service to feature Marvel and National Geographic content it will obtain through its acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report business, it plans to continue relying on Hulu to distribute Fox and FX studio content.

With 17 million paid subs as of January, Hulu also has much less scale than Netflix or Amazon. The service has carved out a streaming niche by offering an unmatched library of licensed TV shows and developing a handful of popular originals, but its relatively small subscriber base will remain a handicap.

And by splitting its non-sports streaming offerings between two services, Disney could have a harder time winning over consumers already signed up for some combination of Netflix, Amazon and HBO's services -- particularly ones that don't have kids. Moreover, with Disney set to have a majority stake in Hulu following the Fox deal's closing, there's some risk that minority investors NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) could become less enthusiastic about providing popular content for the service.

As for ESPN Plus, it's quite clear that Disney, which is believed to have seen ESPN's pay-TV subscriber base fall by 13 million over the last 6 years to 87 million, doesn't want to do anything to cannibalize pay-TV revenue streams. And those revenue streams remain massive: ESPN's family of channels are believed to cost over $9 per subscriber month alone, per SNL Kagan.

In addition to not showing any NFL or NBA games, Disney has signaled it doesn't plan to heavily use the regional sports content it will be getting through the Fox deal to strengthen ESPN Plus. Also, it remains to be seen just how many MLB, NHL and college games likely to appeal to a national audience will be shown on the service.

Nonetheless, ESPN Plus' aggressive pricing and support for a number of different pro and college leagues could let it appeal to some sports junkies. Just as Hulu appeals to TV junkies, and the upcoming Disney service, backed by an unmatched treasure trove of IP, should appeal to many households with kids as well as big fans of Disney's superhero franchises.

All of that provides Disney with a foundation for creating a sizable direct-to-consumer streaming business. It just doesn't give the company a Netflix-killer, or a way to fully offset the continued loss of ESPN pay-TV subs to cord-cutting with a sports streaming service.

65,"Jul 21, 2017",MarketWatch,Hollywood is using social causes to sell movie tickets,"Two days before the June release of Kate Mara’s latest film “Megan Leavey,” the “House of Cards” actress was promoting the movie at an event in Washington.

But Mara wasn’t attending a premiere or a promotional junket for the biopic about marine Megan Leavey and the bond she formed with Rex, her military dog, while serving in Iraq. Instead, she was speaking at a rally calling for the restoration of online animal welfare records held outside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The rally was broadcast live on Mail Online, and an accompanying Care2 petition calling for the release of animal welfare records attracted 160,000 signatures. Megan Leavey, meanwhile, ended up a modest indie hit, grossing nearly $13 million.

That a rally held outside a government building may have been among the film’s most effective promotions highlights the increasing coordination between movie marketing and political and social advocacy. The boundaries between films and social causes are blurring in today’s on-demand, streaming-centered cultural landscape.

“Movie studios are now aligning with good causes to support the release of films in ways that they never used to,” says Cynthia Parsons McDaniel, a former Head of Marketing and PR at three different film studios, who says Twentieth Century Fox FOXA, +1.67% , which partnered with the Teenage Cancer Trust with 2014 teen romantic drama The Fault in Our Stars.

“Whether it’s by doing a film or working with charities or doing certain docuseries, what I’m trying to do is spread positive messages,” actress Cara Delevingne, star of the new film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, recently told WWD.

Hollywood has always been purpose-oriented, both on the screen and off with prominent actor-activists ranging from Ronald Reagan to Angelina Jolie. But now causes are gaining in prominence and priority.

Take Sony’s “The Emoji Movie,” to be released July 28. While the movie is on one hand typical family oriented summer fare, a key component of its marketing is an antibullying campaign.

Sony and the “I Am a Witness” campaign, run by nonprofit organization The Ad Council, released a trailer showcasing footage from the movie that relates to confronting oppression.

“Emoji! I thought the conversation just got dumber,” exclaims a green troll in the trailer. “Internet trolls — just ignore them!” replies Hi-5, the hand emoji, voiced by James Corden.

The campaign aims to give the movie a layer of social worthiness the comedy might otherwise have lacked. “You wouldn’t have seen something like ‘The Emoji Movie’s antibullying trailer accompanying the release of a family movie a decade ago,” said Parsons McDaniel.

The biggest blockbusters now associate themselves with the worthiest missions. The “Star Wars: Force for Change” program, a charity launched by Lucasfilm and Disney in 2014, “harnesses the power of ‘Star Wars’ to empower and improve the lives of children around the world,” according to its website.

The Force for Change program might not exactly be in danger of eclipsing Han Solo in minds of Star Wars fans, but it is by no means an insubstantial part of the galaxy.

A recent fundraising campaign, held to coincide with “Star Wars’” 40th anniversary, raised $3.4 million with proceeds benefiting Unicef and Starlight Children’s Foundation. (Rival sci-fi franchise ‘Star Trek’ also runs a number of charities overseen by its distributor Paramount.)

Investing in good deeds amounts to loose change for a Disney DIS, +4.04% or VIA, +0.59% franchise. For some films, however, an association with a cause can carry significant risk.

“The Promise,” a drama starring Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac set against the backdrop of the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks that began in 1915, was released in 2016. The film’s budget, reportedly just under $100 million, was funded by late Armenian-American businessman Kirk Kerkorian.

Despite wide distribution and a release coinciding with a movement for Congress to promote a bill requesting that the U.S. government highlight the killings, “The Promise” attracted mediocre reviews and grossed just $8.2 million in the U.S. Its mission was further derailed by a vociferous social media campaign in which Turkish websites flooded popular film database IMBD with one-star reviews.

The renewed emphasis on philanthropy is changing how filmmakers view their creative projects. Yet some movie industry creatives think the emphasis on messaging can go too far.

“Causes are at the forefront of movies more than ever and the activism among actors, suppressed for a long time by the studios, is now considered a positive,” says Emmy-winning screenwriter Jake Jacobson. “But it’s getting to be product placement for ideology. I don’t see what benefit it is for a film to do that other than preach to the choir.”

“Twenty years ago, you could have just told a story and people would have read into it what they wanted,” said Ernest Thompson, who won an Oscar for writing 1981 tear-jerker “On Golden Pond” and directed “1969,” a 1988 Vietnam War drama. “Now audiences are hungry for guidance and inspiration to step outside of the norm.”

Thompson is now developing a movie entitled “Allegiance Farm” about child abuse. “My intention is for the girl I cast to become a spokesperson for other children to have the courage to speak out,” he said, using her stardom and social media to boost advocacy on the issue — something he says wasn’t possible three decades ago.

“Now the girl who gets cast [in Allegiance Farm] can get people’s attention and tell other [abused] children where they can get help and give them ideas,” Thompson said. “The implications for this are limitless.”

Yet Thompson still believes subtlety is key for entertaining, rather than just educating, an audience. “If a movie is advertised as a message, you’ve got a problem,” he said. “If you can make an audience laugh and think, you’re accomplishing your goals more effectively.”","That a rally held outside a government building may have been among the film’s most effective promotions highlights the increasing coordination between movie marketing and political and social advocacy.

66,"Jan 23, 2018",TheStreet,Netflix's Torrid Growth Has Earned It a Green Light to Spend Spend Spend,"The streaming giant easily beat subscriber estimates and also issued strong guidance. That's why markets aren't worried about its plans to burn through $3 billion to $4 billion in cash this year.

With Netflix (NFLX) - Get Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Report having put another blowout quarter on its books, Wall Street isn't batting an eye at the streaming giant's ambitious 2018 spending plans.

Netflix reported Q4 revenue of $3.29 billion (up 33% annually) and GAAP EPS of $0.41, nearly in-line with consensus estimates of $3.28 billion and $0.41. More importantly, the company reported it added 1.98 million U.S. and 6.36 million international streaming subscribers, easily topping guidance of 1.25 million and 5.05 million.

In addition, Netflix guided for 1.45 million U.S. and 4.9 million Q1 international streaming net adds, above consensus estimates of 1.26 million and 3.76 million. And thanks to both subscriber growth and rising average selling prices (ASPs), it's guiding for Q1 revenue of $3.69 billion (up 40% - the strongest growth seen in recent years) and EPS of $0.63, above consensus estimates of $3.49 billion and $0.54.

Shares rose 8.3% in after-hours trading to $246.50, taking out the highs they made in regular trading on the back of a 3.2% gain. Based on its after-hours close, Netflix now sports a $106 billion market cap.

As expected, Netflix (in spite of having positive EPS) continued burning cash in Q4, thanks largely to its giant content investments. Free cash flow (FCF) was negative $524 million, leading full-year cash burn to total negative $2.02 billion. That was actually near the low end of a guidance range of negative $2 billion to $2.5 billion, something attributed to the push-out of content payments into 2018.

And in spite of its tremendous top-line growth, Netflix expects its cash burn to be within a range of negative $3 billion to $4 billion this year, spending that will lead it to once more tap debt markets. Massive content spend is of course the biggest culprit here: Netflix now expects to spend (on a profit-and-loss basis) $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018. That's revised from prior guidance of $7 billion to $8 billion, and well above a 2017 level of $6 billion.

In addition, on the earnings call, Reed Hastings stated (to little surprise) that content spend will also rise in 2019 and 2020. It shouldn't be long before Netflix's streaming content obligations, which grew by $700 million last quarter to $17.7 billion, surge past $20 billion.

Netflix is also dialing up its spending in other areas. Marketing spend, which rose 29% in 2017 to $1.28 billion, is forecast to rise 56% in 2018 to $2 billion; Netflix suggests it's quite pleased with the payoff it got from heavy Q4 ad spend, and considers it grounds for spending even more. Technology & development (R&D) spend is forecast to grow 23% to $1.3 billion, as Netflix keeps spending heavily on optimizing its apps and content for dozens of countries, screen sizes and connection speeds.

As the after-hours gains show, markets don't seem bothered by all this spending, at least not while subscriber growth remains torrid. Much like Amazon.com (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report and Facebook (FB) - Get Facebook, Inc. Class A Report , Netflix's execution has helped earned it a green light to make giant cash flow-depressing investments. Here, it also doesn't hurt that the company had just $3.7 billion in net debt at the end of 2017, a figure equal to less than 4% of its current market cap.

One does have to wonder, though, to what degree Disney's (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report plans factor into Netflix's budgeting. Over the last five months, the media giant has unveiled plans to pull ts films from Netflix at decade's end, launch a Disney-branded streaming service in 2019 that will be the exclusive home of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars films and inked a deal to buy most of Twenty-First Century Fox's (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report assets for $52.4 billion. All of that gives Netflix fresh incentives to spend more on both content and customer acquisition ahead of the Disney service's launch.

But if Hastings is worried about Disney's moves, he's not signaling it. On the call, he predicted the Disney service ""will be very successful"" and even declared he'd sign up for it just as ""many Disney and Fox executives also subscribe to Netflix and watch our shows."" But Hastings also declared the Disney service no more of a threat to Netflix than Hulu (set to be majority-owned by Disney) is, and reiterated that Netflix only streams Disney films today in a handful of international markets (namely, Canada, The Netherlands and Australia).

And as Q4 results and Q1 guidance show, business is very much booming overseas in the absence of much help from Disney. Netflix ended 2017 with 62.8 million international subs, up from 44.4 million at the end of 2016 and just 30 million at the end of 2015. And with penetration in many big European, Latin American and especially Asian markets still fairly low, there's a lot of room to keep growing.

Things aren't looking too bad in the U.S. either: Netflix's domestic streaming grew by 5.3 million to 54.8 million in 2017, and the Q4 subscriber adds suggest the company's October price hike -- it only covered the U.S. and certain European markets -- was generally taken by subscribers in stride. CFO David Wells confirmed quite a few suspicions on the call when he said that Netflix was ""a little conservative"" with its Q4 guidance due to the price hikes.

And not only did subscribers grow in 2017, so did engagement: Netflix, fairly tight-lipped about sharing viewing data, disclosed that its per-user viewing rose 9% last year. The disclosure comes nine months after Netflix said its subscribers, which at the time totaled 99 million, were collectively watching over 1 billion hours of video per week.

Heavy marketing spend did help boost Q4 subscriber adds, but so did a strong content slate featuring Season 2 of Stranger Things, the Will Smith action/sci-fi film Bright (apparently better-received by Netflix viewers than by critics) and a slew of foreign-language original series'. Partnerships with carriers and pay-TV providers -- some feature service-bundling deals, while others just involve integrating Netflix with pay-TV set-tops -- also helped. Netflix's deal with T-Mobile US (TMUS) - Get T-Mobile US, Inc. Report to have its HD plan included with subscriptions to postpaid T-Mobile unlimited plans is especially noteworthy.

On the other hand, assuming that T-Mobile got a discount for providing Netflix to many millions of subs, the deal might have kept a lid on Netflix's U.S. ASP growth, which was only 5% on an annual basis in spite of the price hikes. Netflix's international ASP, benefiting from both the latest price hikes and ones carried out earlier in 2017, rose 12% excluding currency swings.

On the whole, Netflix's quarter provided additional evidence that its formula for success, with its emphasis on leveraging superior scale to make giant original content investments and leveraging superior data to both fine-tune what viewers are recommended and guide new content investments, has made the company all but bulletproof in a very competitive streaming landscape. At least as long as its content bets keep paying off at a decent rate.

And until Wall Street feels differently about Netflix's formula or its execution against it, it isn't going to be troubled by all that cash burn.

This is the first of a series of articles that describe the extent of women’s wealth gap, why it matters, and what companies can do about it.

While everyone will likely face challenges on their journey to financial wellness, women face specific and systematic gender-based obstacles every day that make their journey more difficult and the destination of financial wellness harder for them to reach. These obstacles include the substantial and cumulative consequences of wage inequality, a lack of access to tools that can help build wealth, an increased debt burden on average as well as the historical and cultural perceptions that surround women’s roles.

Women are twice as likely to live in poverty during retirement compared to men, despite earning the majority of college degrees at every level, including 57 percent of undergraduate, 60 percent of master’s, and 51 percent of doctorates. They participate in comparable numbers to to men in the workforce, comprise 40 percent of breadwinners for their families, and contribute 40% of household income in the U.S. And of the children living in poverty, 56.5 percent live in households headed by women. So not only women, but the next generation of Americans are being left behind.

These statistics should concern everyone. But employers especially should be concerned because women’s participation in the workforce is declining, at a time when the US is facing a scarcity of skilled labor essential to the nation’s economy and to business success and innovation. And recent research indicates that companies with more women in senior management positions are more profitable. Closing women’s wealth gap could provide tremendous benefits on multiple levels—to individuals, businesses, and society in general.

68,"Aug 28, 2017",TheStreet,"No New 'Apprentice' Episodes Planned by NBC, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","Donald Trump's last appearance hosting ""The Apprentice"" was in February 2015. There are no plans for new episodes.

NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" which helped catapult Donald Trump into the White House, has been all but cancelled amid a steady decline in ratings and its close association with the reality-TV show's contentious former host.

Neither NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) - Get Comcast Corporation Class A Report , nor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., which owns rights to the show, have any plans to produce any new episodes of ""The Apprentice"" or ""The Celebrity Apprentice"", shows that made the real estate developer millions of dollars and helped catapult him into the White House, according to sources close to the matter.

Ratings for ""The Apprentice"" and its spin-off, ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" had been been declining in recent years, a trend underscored by ""The New Celebrity Apprentice"" hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, which attracted the smallest audience of any of the serials 15 seasons during an eight-week run that ended in February.

By declaring his candidacy and foregoing the possibility of further seasons of ""The Apprentice,"" Trump may have lost out on millions of dollars. In a 2015 filing with the Federal Election Commission, Trump said he earned nearly $214 million over the course of 11 years a host of both shows.

Yet NBC and MGM have largely moved on from ""The Apprentice,"" the brainchild of the star reality-TV producer, Mark Burnett. Both companies have assembled long pipelines of dramas and reality-TV productions, precluding any need to green light another season of the franchise despite it having been a mainstay of NBC's prime-time schedule for more than a decade.

""There are no plans to put it back into the slate anytime soon,"" said one of the sources.

Renewing ""The Apprentice"" has also been complicated by Trump's election to the presidency, said one of the sources. A string of controversies that began early in his presidential campaign made ""The Apprentice"" less attractive given its close association with the New York businessman, said one of the sources.

The decision by both media companies to pursue other projects, however, was made well before the recent backlash against the president's claim equating American Nazis and Klan followers with those who rallied against them in Charlottesville, Virginia earlier this month, said the sources. NBC cut ties with Trump in June 2015, shortly after he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination by declaring that ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best...They're sending people that have lots of problems...They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""

At that time, NBCUniversal also terminated a joint-venture with Trump to air the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants. NBC and MGM declined to comment on plans for ""The Apprentice,"" or its spin-offs.

For 14 seasons, Trump hosted ""The Apprentice"" and its spin-off, ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" Ratings peaked early as the show's total audience at its debut in 2004 exceeded 20.7 million, surpassed by only ""Sunday Night Football,"" according to Nielsen. Though viewership for ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" would total 9.1 million in 2011, the show's popularity has subsided in recent years, slipping to under 6 million viewers in 2013.

Trump's last appearance as host came in February 2015, four months before announcing his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. More recently, the president took home an undisclosed amount of money for an executive producer credit for ""The New Celebrity Apprentice"" with Schwarzenegger, a former California governor, film actor and world champion body builder.

If Trump had not opted for a career in politics and had convinced NBC and Burnett to produce another season of ""The Apprentice,"" he stood to earn millions of dollars.

To be sure, Trump's businesses have benefited from his election victory. His resorts, hotels and restaurants have increased membership fees and enjoyed higher occupancy rates as a result of him becoming president. Trump has also used the presidency to publicize his various businesses, including a winery near Charlottesville, Va., which he cited at the end of an Aug. 16 press conference held at the Trump Tower in Manhattan.

For NBC, a new season of ""The Apprentice"" has become less important given the success of its Universal Television Alternative Studio, a one-year-old facility that serves as the headquarters for the company's reality-TV productions. NBC and other media companies are producing more of their own shows in-house in order to control costs and streaming rights.

Earlier this summer, NBC launched ""World of Dance"" from its new Los Angeles studio and is scheduled to show ""The Handmade Project"" with Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman in January and ""The Awesome Show"" with Chris Hardwick in the spring of 2018. NBC also retains two of the highest-rated reality franchises on television, ""America's Got Talent"" and the ""The Voice.""

Meanwhile, MGM, a privately-held television and film studio, is in the midst of a turnaround having exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2010, and under CEO Gary Barber, eliminated nearly all of its debt. MGM has controlled ""The Apprentice"" since 2015 when it took full ownership of Burnett's production company.

As part of that 2015 transaction, Burnett was made president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Elevating Burnett's role at MGM remains a part of Barber's strategy to expand the studio's television business. In April, MGM took full control of the premium cable-TV channel, Epix, in a deal valued at $1.03 billion.

Like NBC, MGM also a large pipeline of TV serials, which it licenses to broadcast and cable-TV networks. Those shows include ""Vikings"" on the History Channel, ""Fargo"" on 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report FX Networks, ""The Handmaid's Tale"" for Hulu, and ""Beat Shazam,"" also for Fox.

69,"Aug 8, 2017",Benzinga,The 3 Financial Statements You Need To Know For Stock Research,"One of the most important things you can do when researching a stock if you’re a long-term investor is look at the company’s financial statements. We’re talking balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows.

A company’s financial statements are available on their investor relations page or on the SEC’s website. But if you want to be able to easily look up the statements of multiple companies in one place, you can do that on a site like FinanceBoards, which offers various widgets where you can look up both quarterly and annual statements.

The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet—a breakdown of a company’s assets, liabilities, and capital—shows us what a company is worth at a given time. In other words, how much are their total assets worth, what kind of debt liabilities do they have, and how much shareholder equity is there?

We can view all of this information on FinanceBoards’ Balance Sheet Quarterly Widget, or view it in chart form below.

We can see that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) has more assets than liabilities. The difference between those numbers is the total stockholder equity. So, Netflix was worth about $3.11 billion at the end of June 2017. We can also see that from September 2016-June 2017 Netflix saw a dramatic increase in both assets and liabilities.

The Income Statement

The income statement shows how profitable a company is. It shows us a company’s total revenue, expenses, and the result of those two numbers, net profit. If you want to know how much money a company is making, this is the spot.

To learn more about the Company Financial Statement Widgets on FinanceBoards, check out its Widget Spotlight Series.

Looking at Netflix’s quarterly income statement, we can see that revenue spiked dramatically at the beginning of 2017 but leveled off afterwards. In all, the company generated $65.60 million in net profit in the June 2017 quarter.

The Statement Of Cash Flows

This tells us where in a company cash is going to. Is the company spending money on operations? Mergers and acquisitions? Are they paying it back to shareholders via dividends? The statement of cash flows tells us how a company is spending its money, and what excess money they have left over (this is called free cash flow).

Looking at a chart of Netflix’s statement of cash flows over the last four quarters, we see that they spent far more on operating activities and financial activities in the June 2017 quarter than the March quarter.

Together, these three statements offer critical insight to breaking down a company’s financial health. They’re important enough to take the time to learn how to understand on their own, but it’s also worth having a platform, like FinanceBoards, that can break these complicated statements down in a faster, simpler way in multiple formats on one screen.

70,"Dec 13, 2017",Benzinga,"Jim Chanos Talks The Short-Seller Strategy, Detroit's Bright Future","Short sellers are often characterized as pessimistic, “glass-half-empty” kind of guys. But Jim Chanos doesn’t see it that way. In fact, the way he views his job is almost patriotic.

“I like to say that short sellers are the ultimate capitalists, because for capitalism to work, you have to allocate capital correctly and you also have to be careful that you don’t misallocate it or be subject to fraud,” the founder and managing partner of hedge fund Kynikos said Wednesday during a talk in Detroit, Michigan. “Short sellers are the only real-time market detectives out there.”

Chanos sat down with Quicken Loans Chairman Dan Gilbert to talk the art of short selling and his insight into to the U.S. economy.

How To Trade Like Chanos

Kynikos is “long America” but hedges by shorting “nefarious” business models and rent seekers.

Through the latter method, Chanos helped expose fraud at companies like Enron while profiting off financial disasters such as Conseco, Tyco International and Sunbeam. He expects the recent bull market to draw out more such opportunities.

“The fraud cycle follows the financial cycle with a lag, so that as bull markets progress, people’s sense of disbelief drops and they get more and more willing to chase returns and chase too-good-to-be-true ideas,” he said. “Most frauds at their core are ponzi schemes in effect, and when the market turns down, when people pull back, they pull their money in, they want redemption, and that’s when the Madoffs of the world and others have problems.”

That’s his philosophy. As for his methods, Chanos prefers a “bottoms-up” approach to finding trades — studying individual players for greater industry trends. Enron led to other energy-related plays, Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE: VRX) led to biotech rent seekers, and a look at China’s real estate market inspired a short of the entire economy.

He doesn’t try to time the markets (“I think it’s nearly always impossible”). He doesn’t converse with execs who could compromise trades spilling insider information. He doesn’t listen to market noise, and he keeps a healthy sense of his limited foresight.

“Predicting the future is kind of a coin flip.”

Quicken Loans Chairman Dan Gilbert, left, and short seller Jim Chanos, the president of Kynikos Associates, speak during a fireside chat hosted by Schechter Wealth Wednesday, Dec. 13 in downtown Detroit. Photo by Dustin Blitchok.

The State Of Global Markets

His job requires that kind of humility, but it also takes a good deal of confidence in his research, which has led to some major successes. Chanos’ most recent assessments revealed bountiful targets in the domestic markets.

Kynikos had been aggressively bearish on China in the early 2010s, but the firm has since refocused.

“In the past few years, we’ve reduced our China shorts in our global fund to the lowest it’s been,” Chanos said. “We’re seeing most of our opportunities in the United States on the short side.”

The thesis is partly anchored in the challenged health sector. The corrosion of the Affordable Care Act, which was one of the industry’s “greatest windfalls” ever, could drive lower prices and less usage.

“I’m worried the U.S. health care economy, which is one of the largest sectors, for the first time ever is going to be facing deflation going forward,” he said.

The concept extends to insurers and it extends to pharmaceuticals, such as the Kynikos-shorted Mallinckrodt PLC (NYSE: MNK).

“As the dollars get tighter, as the pie doesn’t expand but shrinks, we’re going to be looking for more and more bad actors like this,” Chanos said. “Over the past 20 years of health care, providers found more and more innovative ways to get paid, and I think going forward, the payers are going to find more and more innovative ways not to pay for this stuff.”

A Shout-Out To The Motor City

But other industries are expected to rise. Speaking to a Detroit crowd, Chanos praised traditional automakers for their increasing “nimbleness” and leadership in autonomy.

“It’s not Silicon Valley, it’s here,” the notable Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) critic said. “Tesla has sold a great story about this, but the actual innovation is happening here [in Detroit] and in Germany.”

Chanos considers Tesla struggling in a capital-intensive business and shooting warning flares with a quiet exodus of senior executives, accounting concerns and shows of “unbelievably bad corporate governance.”

“He’s an icon for this bull market,” Chanos said of CEO Elon Musk. “Every bull market has its poster children for the bull market both good and bad. I believe Tesla is one of the bad ones… He sells you on a dream. When the dream becomes a bit mundane, he sells you on the next dream.”

“I think Tesla’s heading for a brick wall. He’s going to hit the parachute before the shareholders do.”

72,"Dec 18, 2017",Benzinga,Is Bitcoin Predictable? This AI Software Says It is,"Is the price of a cryptocurrency like bitcoin predictable?

That’s one of the fundamental questions Wall Street has about the new asset. How do you predict something that’s risen over 1500 percent since the start of the year? And how do you predict something that’s supposedly uncorrelated to every other market?

Well, according to one company, cryptocurrencies are correlated to other markets—30, to be exact—and are therefore predictable.

That’s according to VantagePoint, an artificial intelligence software utilizing deep learning neural networks to forecast next-day high and low prices on equities, commodities, and currencies. The platform added cryptocurrencies last week.

While there is a certain degree of unpredictability in the crypto market due to the sheer amount of emotional trading going on around it, VantagePoint Vice President Lane Mendelsohn said some of the digital currencies do actually have varying degrees of correlation with precious metals, tech-based U.S. Equities, U.S. retail equities, and certain ETFs.

“There is an element of what’s driving the cryptocurrency prices now which is emotion, obviously,” he said. “Greed, fear, and that kind of stuff can’t be predicted. But what’s really driving it is the impact that other markets have. What the stock market is doing does have an impact on bitcoin. What other currency prices are doing does have an impact on bitcoin. What’s happening to gold does have an impact on bitcoin.”

How exactly does it predict price?

Mendelsohn explained that it requires a more detailed analysis than just looking at a chart or computing a simple, linear correlation analysis. The global nature of today’s interconnected financial markets, including the new cryptocurrencies, means that all sorts of global data need to be analyzed, he said.

“VantagePoint’s AI engine does this. This is analysis that a human just couldn’t do. This technology is very global. We can get the data, we can feed it into our AI engine, and we can determine what other markets drive the price of bitcoin.”

That analysis yields the top 30 most influential markets. This lets the software make its forecasts, based on a non-linear ‘weight matrix’ that mathematically details the extent to which each of these 30 related markets impacts the target market.

“Market relationships are not stagnant. It’s not a one size fits all,” he said. “The 30 markets that drive bitcoin are not the exact same 30 markets that drive ethereum. Whatever the 30 markets are that drive bitcoin is today, those might not be the same that drive bitcoin three months from now.”

Mendelsohn said that the platform will offer forecasts up to three days out for bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. Those are the three cryptos he said the platform can meet or surpass a baseline 80 percent accuracy rate.

“Those other cryptocurrencies are newer, and the way the artificial intelligence works is it needs a lot of data,” he said. “If there’s not a lot of data to sift through, it may see a pattern but it may not see a pattern that holds true long term. But also some of those cryptocurrencies are somewhat manipulated. And if something is manipulated, it’s not really predictable.”

75,"Jan 13, 2018",TheStreet,40 Stocks That Could Make You Rich This Winter,"Stephen 'Sarge' Guilfoyle gives you a peek inside his order book. From Apple to General Electric, there are many good buys.

It's January, and while it's cold in many locales, the financial markets have been downright hot so far in 2018.

Can this uptrend keep going? Yes. But the constant 11-man blitz? No. It's true that earnings growth is real, and that corporate tax cuts will only enhance them. Those same cuts will also likely inspire some additional U.S. economic growth. I'll let the academics in their ivory towers fight over how exactly how much; I'm just here to make a buck.

Given all of the above, how am I hitting them? Let's see where we stand:

Banks

Although the Federal Reserve has been lifting the Fed funds rate for some time now, any increases to the yield curve's long end had always been fake-outs.

But while it seemed for a while like the 2-year/10-year U.S. Treasury yield spread was heading to below 50 basis points, this spread -- which is so important to traditional banking -- suddenly seems to be working its way closer to 60.

There's now optimism across the group as tax cuts kick in and foreign central-bank activity is expected to let up on the long end. Yes, there will be costly one-time charges associated with tax cuts, but they're a net positive for the group.

Citigroup (C) - Get Citigroup Inc. Report is still my favorite stock in the sector. Although the name has traded sideways of late, I still like it based on valuation and global exposure despite that expected $20 billion one-time charge related to tax reform. I've also been angling for a way to get involved in PNC Financial (PNC) - Get PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Report , but am not currently in the name.

My regional-bank play is KeyCorp (KEY) - Get KeyCorp (KEY) Report , which has been an extremely positive contributor since mid-November. I also remain long two ETFs in this space -- the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) - Get SPDR S&P Bank ETF Report and the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN) - Get iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF Report . KBE gives my portfolio broad exposure to the space, while EUFN does the same trick for me in Europe should the European Central Bank ever get its horse and ride the tightening trend a little harder.

Keybanc is a holding in TheStreet Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus.

Defense/Aerospace

The alarm bells have all gone quiet in this space. North and South Korea seem to love each other again, and the upcoming Winter Olympics outside Seoul should be a piece of cake.

But all of that means nothing over the long term, gang. After all, North Korea remains unpredictable, the global threat of terrorism hasn't gone away, there are bad actors throughout the Middle East and Asia, and Russia is still ... well, Russia.

So, my favorite names in this sector remain Raytheon (RTN) - Get Raytheon Company Report and Lockheed Martin (LMT) - Get Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Report , and both have been excellent plays for me so far in January. Fortunately, I added a bit to my LMT long on a discount in December.

Elsewhere in the sector, II-VI (IIVI) has seemingly recovered from an early December sell-off and is now approaching a so-called ""double top."" I've stuck it out so far, but I'm a little less trusting of this name these days.

As for Kratos Defense (KTOS) - Get Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. Report , what can I say? I took profits back in October at advantageous prices, and then I bought the shares back in November at what seemed at the time like a discount. I'm up small from there, but the company's debt load just seems to be a bit weighty this time around. This must be the only defense stock that's fighting a back-and-forth battle in January.

Energy

Regular readers know that I don't trade the whole energy sector, just two stocks that I love to trade because I think I'm pretty good at it -- Apache Corp. (APA) - Get Apache Corporation Report and Schlumberger (SLB) - Get Schlumberger NV Report .

It sounds like bragging (and maybe it is), but the trading that I did with Apache in 2017 was among the best of my career. I originally got into the name early in the year in the high $50s (vs. the stock's $43.16 price late Friday). But APA began to move so predictably by early August that by simply trading its established support and resistance levels, I was able to turn a profit for the year. And now, my average price for Apache is very close to the stock's 2017 low.

More of What's Trending on TheStreet:

I remain long in the name because 1) it's winter, and 2) yes, the Saudis are going shopping. That said, despite signs of a breakout, I recently took a little off of the top on my Apache stake when the name passed $45. For now, I'm sticking with ""Buy at $40, Sell at $45"" until it doesn't work.

Schlumberger is a holding in TheStreet Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus.

Meanwhile, my trading in Schlumberger has been far less prolific, but has nonetheless turned out to be very positive. This name has simply gone parabolic so far in 2018, and SLB still pays nearly a 2.7% dividend yield even at the higher prices. My advice: Buy some.

FAANG and FAANG Types

I took some off of my position in Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. (AAPL) Report twice when the stock hit my $176 price target twice, but I decided to hang onto some the last time it got to that level. Good thing, as the stock rallied Friday to close at $177.09. Apple has seen multiple top at around $176 and the algos see that. The bots are either going to back off or kick the door in. I'll take some more off of the stock next Tuesday after Monday's market holiday, but if Apple breaks back down to $167, I'm ""outta here.""

Apple is a holding in TheStreet Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus.

Elsewhere in the sector, I remain long on Amazon (AMZN) - Get Amazon.com, Inc. Report and Alibaba (BABA) - Get Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Sponsored ADR Report . Both are rocking and I plan to remain long on both because expect their dominant positions in their respective markets to play out well long term.

That said, there's just too much risk in owning a ton of these kinds of stocks. So, what I like to do such names is maintain a core position and trade a smaller amount around news events such as earnings releases.

Meanwhile, I've added Alphabet (GOOG) - Get Alphabet Inc. Class C Report , (GOOGL) - Get Alphabet Inc. Class A Report since last month, and I boosted my long in Netflix (NFLX) - Get Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Report on the stock's December sell-off. While I expect to remain long on GOOGL, my NFLX holding is just a short-term trade that I look forward to ringing the register on if it rises.

I know what you're thinking: ""Umm, Netflix is already up since December, Sarge."" Thanks, but I think I can at least another a few more bucks from here. However, I don't trust that name long term in the wake of the deal between Walt Disney Co. (DIS) - Get Walt Disney Company Report and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Class A Report .

Infrastructure

I got myself long in several infrastructure plays in the wake of the terrible storms that hit parts of America in August and September -- and they all worked.

I've taken profits on three -- Weyerhaeuser (WY) - Get Weyerhaeuser Company Report , Owens-Corning (OC) - Get Owens Corning Report and Valero Energy (VLO) - Get Valero Energy Corporation Report -- but hung on to one: United Rentals (URI) - Get United Rentals, Inc. Report , I thought it would turn into a solid play on a U.S. government fiscal-spending plan, and wow -- it's been absolute dynamite.

I also got into U.S. Concrete (USCR) - Get U.S. Concrete, Inc. Report during the market's mid-December sell-off. That's been another winner.

Retail

Many readers know that I love only two names in this space -- Kohl's (KSS) - Get Kohl's Corporation (KSS) Report and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) - Get Walmart Inc. Report. Both have treated me spectacularly well in 2017, and both are strutting their stuff again so far in January.

Now, you're never supposed to fall in love with your holdings, but it's hard not to with these two. That's probably because I was so far out in front of the move up on both of these that I actually took some ribbing from some well-known financial-media types early on for being long these names.

I've also added Macy's (M) - Get Macy's Inc Report to my retail book. I don't love the name, but I do love its dividend. I was lightening up on a tech position that I felt I was over-exposed in, so I sold it and stuffed the dough in Macy's for safekeeping. However, Macy's has gone precisely sideways since my purchase.

Tech

Two of my best trades ever were owning Nvidia (NVDA) - Get NVIDIA Corporation Report and Lam Research (LRCX) - Get Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) Report in 2017. I've traded in and out them several times over the past two months or so and am currently long a reduced amount in both.

Nvidia is a holding in TheStreet Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus.

LRCX was easy to trade in December, but NVDA has tricked me a couple of times. But what a beast! I don't think I'm ever going to completely give up on that one.

Techs might not see the huge reduction in corporate taxes that stocks in many other sectors will -- they don't need to, they already had low rates -- but that might still provoke some attempts at a rotation out of tech. But ultimately, tech is tech.

Cloud services, artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous driving, big data -- all commerce relies upon tech. All commerce. So, that's where I'll plant my flag.

Another big tech winner for me in 2017 was Intel (INTC) - Get Intel Corporation (INTC) Report . If there's a better CEO in the business than Brian Krzanich, I'm not aware of it. That said, Intel's recent chip woes are cause for at least some caution. So, I shaved 30% off of my position at the first sign of the bad news. (That's where my newfound interest in Macy's came from.)

Elsewhere in semiconductor-associated names, I initiated a long position in NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) - Get NXP Semiconductors NV Report as I wait for Qualcomm QCOM to either push the envelope and up NXPI takeover bid or give up. I also remain long Seagate Technology (STX) - Get Seagate Technology PLC Report for the dividend. I didn't see the Ripple news coming, but yowza! The stock surprised me and turned in a really great month of December even before it spiked higher.

I'm also long Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - Get Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Report , largely because I bought it when I shouldn't have and there just isn't all that much downside risk. The name also acts as a hedge of sorts for when Intel gets shaky.

As for the cloud, my play there had been Oracle (ORCL) - Get Oracle Corporation Report , but that's turned out to be wrong. So, I rotated half of that position into Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Report in early December. I probably should have done the whole thing, but at least this improved my situation. Besides, both of these names are showing signs of life.

Elsewhere in the sector, I initiated Applied Materials (AMAT) - Get Applied Materials, Inc. Report and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) - Get KLA Corporation (KLAC) Report -- my 2018 top pick -- with partial positions. Both names are acting well so far. I also initiated a small position in Xerox (XRX) - Get Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX) Reportafter the Carl Icahn news for that stock. Call it an impulse purchase, which I'll play by ear.

Lastly, my exposure to the gaming community remains Activision Blizzard (ATVI) - Get Activision Blizzard, Inc. Report , which might not be upwardly mobile, but is at least tradeable. This name stalled at the $67 level several times, but broke to the upside Friday. I had been ""churning"" it, but now that its broken upside resistance, I'm likely to ride it for while.

Microsoft and Nvidia are holdings in TheStreet Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus.

Transports

As the U.S. economy grows, the transports should do well. CSX Corp. (CSX) - Get CSX Corporation Report -- my railroad play -- had been trading in a sloppy fashion, but has suddenly performed well. CEO Hunter Harrison's startling recent death didn't help the stock, but the market's traditional Santa Claus Rally paid a visit to the name.

Christmas was also very kind to FedEx (FDX) - Get FedEx Corporation Report , my delivery-services play, which has absolutely roared since mid-November. I hold the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN) - Get SPDR S&P Transportation ETF Reportas well. This gives me the transportation exposure that I want while allowing me to keep my active positions at a manageable level

Other Sectors

I had two other plays that are hard to pinhole into certain categories -- Kimberly Clark (KMB) - Get Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) Report and General Electric (GE) - Get General Electric Company (GE) Report .

KMB was my ""cheap-dollar"" play, as they do a large share of their business overseas. This strategy worked, but I've sold out as the U.S. Dollar Index stabilized.

GE is a holding in TheStreet Jim Cramer's Action Alerts Plus.

By contrast, I have to honestly classify GE as a mistake. But fortunately, I've been able to greatly reduce my effective entry point on the name through the magic of selling both sides of the options market,. (Of course, selling puts also got this position to where it is.)

I'm not home yet, but there's definitely light at the end of the tunnel. The position is at this point manageable, and the dividend really ain't so bad even though GE recently cut it in half.
